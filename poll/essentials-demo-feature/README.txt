Hippo Essentials Plugin Feature
===============================
This module contains a Hippo Essentials Plugin Feature. It adds a custom poll document: a document in the project
namespace with a title and the poll compound. It also adds a rendering template and some HST configuration for it.

To use this feature, add a dependency to this artifact to the Essentials module of a Hippo project. After a (re)build it
will show up in the Feature Library.

This Poll Demo feature will only work correctly if the Poll feature is installed BEFORE this feature.
