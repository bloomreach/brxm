/**
 * Checks whether a value adheres to certain constraints.
 *
 * The value type {@link V} should match with the JCR type of the value for which the validator is used.
 * For example, a field of type String will get a {@link String} value. Using a validator with an incompatible
 * value type will result in a {@link ClassCastException} at runtime.
 *
 * Implementations should either provide a public no-arguments constructor, or a public constructor that accepts
 * a single argument of type {@link Map <String, String>}. The latter will get all custom configuration properties
 * as key-value pairs.
 *
 * The system reuses a single instance of each validator, so implementations must be thread-safe.
