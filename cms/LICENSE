      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    The above modules make use of, but do not bundle, the GPLv3 licensed ExtJS JavaScript framework
    under the Open Source License Exception for Development, http://www.sencha.com/license

    From http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/open-source-license-exception-for-development/ :


    Exception for Development Version 1.04, January 18, 2013

    Exception Intent

    We want people who build extensions, developer toolkits and frameworks, language packs and
    themes for Sencha frameworks and libraries to be able to publicly distribute them under less
    restrictive license terms, even though version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the “GPL”) may
    require them to be licensed under the GPL.

    This Exception does not grant usage or distribution of any Sencha development library under a
    license other than the GPL and cannot be applied to end-user applications. For applications, please
    refer to the Open Source License Exception for Applications.

    Terms and Conditions

    Definitions

        - Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.
        - “Library” means Ext JS, Sencha Touch or Sencha GXT, for which this exception is applicable.
        - “Code” means source code for the Library or Extension.
        - “Images” means images distributed with Code.
        - “Modification” means a visual change or enhancement made to a Library Component
          (“Component”) by means of modifying the standard functionality or visual appearance of the
          Component.

    *“Extension” means the combination of Code and Images to form a Modification or a completely new
    and original Component.

    Additional Grants

    As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:

    You are free to distribute an Extension licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in
    section 5, as long as:

        - Your Extension does not contain any Code or modified Code from the Library.
        - You do not distribute the Library, as a whole or in part, with your Extension. Optionally, you
          should include instructions for developers using your Extension explaining how to obtain the
          Library.
        - You include PROMINENT notice in EVERY location you display the license information for your
          Extension that it uses the Library, that the Library is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3
          and you must include a link to http://www.sencha.com/license.
        - Your Extension is distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and is
          accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the same
          medium and under the same FLOSS license as the Extension
        - Your Extension can reasonably be considered to be adding to or modifying standard
          functionality of the Library for software development purposes and does not constitute an
          independent and separate application in itself.

    Applicability

    This exception applies to Ext JS version 2.2 or later, Sencha Touch 1.0 or later and Sencha GXT
    version 1.0 or later released under the GPL that contain a conspicuous notice with the Derivative
    Work and conspicuously posted online near any download location, saying that Derivative Works
    built using the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception and that the included
    Library is subject to the terms of the GPL v3.

    This Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Library under any
    license other than the GPL v3.

    Termination

    If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are
    void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the GPL v3.

        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
           trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that
           You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
           following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
           Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
           by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
           NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own
           attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
           NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
           modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license
    terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative
    Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
    conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
       for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
       without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
       modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
       Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
    product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
    the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
       Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
       OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
       NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
       determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with
       Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
       contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
       or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
       special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
       the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
       computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
       Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
       You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
       obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
       You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
       and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
       or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
       liability.
