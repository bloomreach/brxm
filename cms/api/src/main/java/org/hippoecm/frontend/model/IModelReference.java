/**
 * Service interface for sharing models.  When a model is shared between plugins and it is subject to change,
 * it should be wrapped in an IModelReference service.  The service is usually available under the configuration
 * key 'wicket.model'.
 * <p>
 * This service is observable as well, so it is possible to receive model change events by registering an
 * {@link IObserver} with the service as the observable.  An {@link IModelChangeEvent} should be sent whenever
 * {@link IModelReference#setModel} is invoked.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation {@link ModelReference}, takes care of sending the events.
 * <p>
 * Model services should be registered before any of the plugins that uses them is started.  This makes it
 * easier to create plugins that consume models (they don't need to register service trackers).  Since generally
 * a model is injected into a new plugin cluster, this is usually quite a natural thing to do.
