/**
 * The description of a (JCR) type.  The type system is based on the JCR one, but enriched with
 * additional information for the CMS interface.
 * <p>
 * One refinement over the JCR type system is the use of 'pseudo-types'.  These types do not directly
 * correspond to JCR types, but instead use a different type for their storage (the 'real' type).
 * This allows additional semantics to be provided on top of simpler storage, and is usually also represented
 * differently in the document editor.
 * <p>
 * The mutator methods / setters can only be used in a type editing context such as the document type editor.
 * In other cases, the type should be considered immutable and the mutator methods may not be invoked.
