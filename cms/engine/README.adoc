== Update the navapp and navapp-communication libary

The navigation application ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bloomreach/navapp[navapp] )
and the navigation applicaiton communication library ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bloomreach/navapp-communication[navapp-communication] ) are projects
that are hosted on https://www.npmjs.com[npm].

The navigation application will load from a cdn in a production environment that will always serve the latest version.

As a backup a version from the navigation application is added to the build as well. During the maven build
of this module it is included in the artifact of this module.

When a new version is available maven will not pull in the latest version automatically. The
steps needed to update to the latest version are described below.
