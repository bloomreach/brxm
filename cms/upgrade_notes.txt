# Cleanup the UI in dev mode

- The YUI logger is disabled in dev mode, see api/src/main/java/org/hippoecm/frontend/plugins/yui/inc/hippo/281/hippologger/hippologger-debug.js 
- The Wicket debug widget is hidden in dev mode, see api/src/main/styling/src/less/lib/wicket.less

# Code changes

- org.hippoecm.frontend.service.ITitleDecorator now implements a new method: public ResourceReference getActiveIcon(IconSize type);
  This method is implemented in org.hippoecm.frontend.plugins.standards.perspective.Perspective so custom perspectives
  will not break, but anything else that implements ITitleDecorator will have to at least implement the method and return null;

# Configuration changes

## Root plugin
- The document tabs were served by a built-in extension named top, configured with property top. This is now handled as
  a plugin extension configured with the wicket.extensions property.
- The logout button will be visible as a perspective switcher in the new UI. For this the configuration of the RootPlugin
  has changed (the logout.extension is removed) and a new LogoutPerspective is added to cms-static
