How to test and build Hippo CMS 7
========================================

1. Introduction

  Very brief introduction to how to build and test Hippo CMS!

2. Requirements --

  (1) Java 1.6
  (2) Maven 3.0.x

3. Build 
     
    (1) Build with testing
    
      $ mvn clean install
    
    (2) Build with skipping tests
    
      $ mvn clean install -DskipTests
    
    (3) Build with Hippo Snapshot Repository Flag
      - Note: Mostly you do not need this when you check out and build a released version!
              Only when you build the TRUNK having snapshot dependencies!
      - Add `-Dhippo.snapshots' for snapshot dependencies.
        For example,
        
        $ mvn clean install -Dhippo.snapshots -DskipTests
