    This module makes use of, but does not bundle, the GPLv3 licensed ExtJS JavaScript framework
    under the Open Source License Exception for Development, http://www.sencha.com/license

    From http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/open-source-license-exception-for-development/ :


    Exception for Development Version 1.04, January 18, 2013

    Exception Intent

    We want people who build extensions, developer toolkits and frameworks, language packs and
    themes for Sencha frameworks and libraries to be able to publicly distribute them under less
    restrictive license terms, even though version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the “GPL”) may
    require them to be licensed under the GPL.

    This Exception does not grant usage or distribution of any Sencha development library under a
    license other than the GPL and cannot be applied to end-user applications. For applications, please
    refer to the Open Source License Exception for Applications.

    Terms and Conditions

    Definitions

        - Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.
        - “Library” means Ext JS, Sencha Touch or Sencha GXT, for which this exception is applicable.
        - “Code” means source code for the Library or Extension.
        - “Images” means images distributed with Code.
        - “Modification” means a visual change or enhancement made to a Library Component
          (“Component”) by means of modifying the standard functionality or visual appearance of the
          Component.

    *“Extension” means the combination of Code and Images to form a Modification or a completely new
    and original Component.

    Additional Grants

    As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:

    You are free to distribute an Extension licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in
    section 5, as long as:

        - Your Extension does not contain any Code or modified Code from the Library.
        - You do not distribute the Library, as a whole or in part, with your Extension. Optionally, you
          should include instructions for developers using your Extension explaining how to obtain the
          Library.
        - You include PROMINENT notice in EVERY location you display the license information for your
          Extension that it uses the Library, that the Library is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3
          and you must include a link to http://www.sencha.com/license.
        - Your Extension is distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and is
          accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the same
          medium and under the same FLOSS license as the Extension
        - Your Extension can reasonably be considered to be adding to or modifying standard
          functionality of the Library for software development purposes and does not constitute an
          independent and separate application in itself.

    Applicability

    This exception applies to Ext JS version 2.2 or later, Sencha Touch 1.0 or later and Sencha GXT
    version 1.0 or later released under the GPL that contain a conspicuous notice with the Derivative
    Work and conspicuously posted online near any download location, saying that Derivative Works
    built using the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception and that the included
    Library is subject to the terms of the GPL v3.

    This Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Library under any
    license other than the GPL v3.

    Termination

    If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are
    void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the GPL v3.
