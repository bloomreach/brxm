    <span class='shortdesc'>Start Eclipse to work on Hippo CMS addon projects.</span>

    <p>General information about starting Eclipse
      for Hippo projects can be found
      <a href='../../../tools/howto/eclipse/start_eclipse.html'>here</a>.
      For Hippo CMS addon projects, you need to checkout the Hippo CMS 7 and have
      it as a subproject. As the Hippo CMS 7 is very large, eclipse has to be configured
      to allow for large sizes:
    </p>

    <p>Start eclipse with some memory flags to the Eclipse -vmargs startup argument:
     <ul>
      <li>Set the heap size to at least 512M by adding something like -Xms512M -Xmx512M</li>
      <li>Set the permSpace size to at least 128M by adding something like -XX:MaxPermSize=128M</li>
     </ul>
     <source>eclipse -vmargs -Xms512M -Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M</source>
     <p>In order not to type this every time, you can do one of the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>configure your file browser to use these
       flags every time you (double)click on eclipse to start it.
      </li>
      <li>add the flags to your inititialisation file of eclipse.</li>
      <li>For a Unix shell, you can define an alias or write a one-liner script.</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     The eclipse workspace used for Hippo CMS addon projects
     has to be <a href='./configure_workspace.html'>configured for them</a>.
   </p>
