      <span class="shortdesc">Extend Hippo CMS with your own add-ons.</span>

      <p>
        Customizability of Hippo CMS is achieved by means of a configurable plugin framework.
        All functionality outside the core is implemented as plugins, which can be extended and customized.
        New plugins can be written to add functionality. New functionality will typically be
        implemented as an add-on, consisting of a number of plugins.        
      </p>
