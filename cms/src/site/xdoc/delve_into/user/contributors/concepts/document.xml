          <p>
           In general, a document is a physical representation of a some information. Note that the physical representation need not be
           readable by humans. It may for example be electronic. However, any physical representation of information can be transformed to another
           physical representation of the same information, so can be made readable by humans.  
          </p>
          <p>Hippo CMS is fully configurable and any organization can define concepts like document and use Hippo CMS accordingly.
             The Hippo CMS default content is an example of such a choice. Here, 'documents', 'images' and 'files' are presented such that
             it is suggested that they are mutally exclusive. A definition in accordance with this use would be that
             only user files that contain information that Hippo CMS can read are documents. Other files are images and just files.
             E.g., Hippo can store PDF documents, but can not read them, so to Hippo PDF documents are no documents, just files.  
      </p>
          <p>That Hippo CMS can read documents means that Hippo CMS can help perform advanced searches on those documents and can help 
             you generate such documents, telling you what information in your organization should
             be stored in a document of a particular type.
          </p> 

         <h4>Etymology</h4>
          <p>From latin <i>docere</i>: to teach.
