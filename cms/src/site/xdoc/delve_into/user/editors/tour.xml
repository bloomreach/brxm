  <section name="Hippo CMS Editor Tour">
    <span class='shortdesc'>To get introduced to the role of CMS Editor, take the following tour.</span> 

     <p>To get introduced to the role of CMS editor, you will look over the shoulder of
        Janine, who works for the imaginary organization Swatia,
        an organization of people very interested in music, art and knowledge. We did not imagine an
        answer to the question whether Swatia is a commercial organization, a hobby organization, or both. 
    </p>
    <p>Swatia decided to publish an online newspaper about music, art and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>Janine will for example decide if articles written by contributors can be published in
       the Swatia newspaper.
    </p>
