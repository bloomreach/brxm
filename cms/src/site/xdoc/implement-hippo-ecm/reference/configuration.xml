      <section name="HST Configuration">
        <p>
          In the application's web deployment descriptor (web.xml), a general HST configuration file is set 
          up holding configuration for the connection to the repository. You 
          may add your own configuration files at will.</p>
        <p>  
          Secondly, the basic HST functionality is set up by configuring one or more filters in your 
          web.xml. These filters will make access to the repository from your jsp files available.</p>
         <p> 
          Thirdly, when wanting to view images or other binaries, a servlet for binaries has to be set up
          in the web.xml as well. 
        </p>
        <subsection name="General configuration file(s)">
          <p>Repository configuration is set up in a separate properties file.
            The file plus an accompanying configuration object is set up in web.xml with a combination 
            <code>&lt;context-param&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code>.</p>
           <p>The context parameter is called <code>configurationFiles</code> which represents a 
              comma-separated list of configuration file locations. The object's listener class is 
              <code>org.hippoecm.hst.core.HSTConfiguration</code>.
           </p>

        </subsection>
        <a name="BinariesServlet"></a>
        <subsection name="Configuration of the servlet for binaries">
          <p>A separate servlet is available in the HST, that can serve binaries such as images and documents 
            from any location within the repository based on the URL path it recieves.</p>
          <p>If you need binaries in your application, use a regular <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code>
            configuration with class <code>org.hippoecm.hst.BinariesServlet</code>. 
            Set up a descriptive <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;</code> like <code>/binaries/*</code>, 
            that you will have to use as prefix in your jsp's, for instance in the in a the <code>src</code> 
            attribute of the &lt;img&gt; tag (<a href="binaries.html">more here</a>).</p>
