# Build
Build with testing:

    $ mvn clean install

Build without testing:

    $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

Build with snapshot dependencies:

    $ mvn clean install -Dhippo.snapshots=true

 Note: only needed when the project refers to SNAPSHOT dependencies!

 Note: only effective when your Maven settings.xml file contains a profile
       with this property for the Hippo snapshot repository. For details, see
       http://www.onehippo.org/library/development/build-hippo-cms-from-scratch.html

# Front-end Installation and Building
* Run these commands from either the api or the console/frontend module

Install project dependencies

    $ npm install
    
Build front-end code

    $ npm run build

# Developing the front-end code (api, login and console/frontend modules only)
After building the front-end code:

    $ npm start

This will handle the following cases:
    * If a change in a LESS file is detected it will recompile all LESS files, copy the theme to the CLASSPATH and (if
      enabled) live-reload your browser.
    * If a change in an image is detected it will re-create the SVG sprite and copy all images and icons to the CLASSPATH.

You need to start the CMS in Wicket Development Mode so it picks up front-end changes.
Run the CMS with Wicket development mode args:

    $ mvn -P cargo.run -Djrebel -Drepo.path=repo -Dcargo.jvm.args='-Dwicket.configuration=development'

# Live reload browser plugins
You need a browser extension to use live reload.
