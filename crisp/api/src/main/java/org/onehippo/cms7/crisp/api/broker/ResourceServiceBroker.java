/**
 * CRISP Resource Service Broker abstraction.
 * <P>
 * This interface abstracts a "Broker" pattern for various {@link Resource}s from different backends.
 * So, application codes can simply invoke operations of this "Broker" interface to retrieve or manipulate any
 * {@link Resource}s from different backends without having to worry about the details about the underlying backends.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Another important aspect is that this "Broker" interface takes care of caching of {@link Resource} representations
 * and cache invalidations. So, application codes do not have to worry about caching and cache invalidations in
 * application layer any more, but they can transparently invoke the operations of this interface. Then this "Broker"
 * implementation should take care of all the details including caching, cache invalidations, etc.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Also, this "Broker" service is normally registered through {@link HippoServiceRegistry} as a {@link SingletonService}.
 * So, applications can access this singleton "Broker" service like the following example:
 * </P>
 * <PRE>
 * ResourceServiceBroker broker = HippoServiceRegistry.getService(ResourceServiceBroker.class);
