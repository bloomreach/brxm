#   This file must contain all files and folders that                    #
#   most be publicly available over http. Typically folders              #
#   that contain server side scripts, such a freemarker                  #
#   templates, should not be added as they in general should             #
#   not be publicly available.                                           #
#                                                                        #
#   The whitelisting is *relative* to the 'web file bundle root'         #
#   which is the folder in which this hst-whitelist.txt file is          #
#   located.                                                             #
#                                                                        #
#   Examples assuming the web file bundle root is 'site':                #
#                                                                        #
#   css/       : whitelists all descendant web files below 'site/css/'   #
#   common.js  : whitelists the file 'site/common.js'                    #
#                                                                        #
#   Note that the whitelisting is 'starts-with' based, thus for          #
#   example whitelisting 'css' without '/' behind it, whitelists all     #
#   files and folders that start with 'css'                              #
#                                                                        #
