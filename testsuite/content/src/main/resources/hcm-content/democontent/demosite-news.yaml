                                              7.0 features a completely new technological core based on Apache
                                              Jackrabbit, introducing full JSR 170 compliancy. The GUI technology
                                              moved to Apache Wicket enabling a modern AJAX GUI with drag drop and
                                              auto-save functionality. Version 7.0 is highly extensible, allowing
                                              organizations to choose from a wide variety of plug-ins in order to
                                              address their precise needs for managing and utilizing their
                                              enterprise content. This flexible architecture also allows
                                              developers to easily add custom functionality if no suitable plug-in

                                              (6.0), with strong separation of concerns and its content driven
                                              repository, has been further improved, introducing a high
                                              performance faceted repository based on Apache Lucene and Apache
                                              Jackrabbit. The faceted repository introduces 'drop and start'
                                              dynamic categorization of content; allowing organizations to

                                              improved ROI compared to traditional CMS.</p>

              <p>The events key note speech by <a
                                              href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/broekema">Jan Willem
                                              Broekema</a>, former director of OSOSS, president of
                                              the Internet Society and management consultant at Het Expertise
                                              Centrum (HEC) showed the great importance the Dutch and European
                                              governments attach to open source. It became clear that there are
                                              enormous opportunities for our partners around open source in the
                                              Government sector.</p> <p>In the
                                              subsequent presentations the Hippo business model and our view of
                                              the open source marketplace were addressed and the way we want to
                                              work with our partners in the future. <br /> The main
                                              presentation was obviously the technology preview by Arjé Cahn
                                              showing the new and upcoming release 7 of <a

                                              CMS</a>.</p> <p>From the
                                              evaluation we learned that the event was highly appreciated by our
                                              partners and that there's certainly a keen interested in future
                                              events. The fact that our partners want to share their knowledge
                                              with each other is obviously something we encourage and fits in the
                                              open source mindset!

                                              to building quality products, it has grown fast. According to

                                              millions of documents of all types. Our products are continuing to

                                              <p>“At the beginning of the year we entered the U.S.
                                              market and have exceeded our sales targets for this key area. Our
                                              support model with guaranteed support and legal indemnification has
                                              been well received in the U.S. market. All signals are that this
                                              growth will continue in 2009 as more and more American companies are
                                              seeing the tremendous ROI open source technology can bring to their
                                              business. With our U.S. office now in full swing we are ready to
                                              meet this increase in demand for our

                                              and especially the government, see Open Source as a better model for
                                              software-development. This makes Amsterdam a well suited location
                                              for a conference like ApacheCon. Last year the organization
                                              committed itself for three years to the dutch capital: with the
                                              government publicly revealing plans to use Open Source software, the
                                              organization decided Holland to be one of the best possible
                                              locations for such an event.</p>

                                              CTO Arjé Cahn: “The fact that ApacheCon again takes place in
                                              Amsterdam should be seen as a compliment. At the same time it is an
                                              opportunity the dutch Open Source community should grab onto with
                                              both hands. It is an excellent possibility to exchange knowledge but

                                              the Hippo CMS will be implemented for the Dutch website. This site
                                              will function as the groundplan for the other fourteen sites for
                                              other country’s in which the IBC is active, amongst which the U.S.,
                                              Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Scandinavia, China and the U.K. In a
                                              later phase of the implementation these other sites will also work
                                              with the Hippo CMS. In the future pictures, texts and video’s will
                                              be added to the site.</p> <p>Wouter
                                              Pasman, Project Manager at Hippo: “we are glad with IBC’s choice for
                                              our CMS. For us it will be an interesting challenge to present the

                                              fashion, but we will definitely be up to the

                                              Manager North-America, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Holland
                                              of IBC: “We were very impressed by the structure and simplicity
                                              which the Hippo CMS has to offer, but also the price and quality
                                              ratio of the Hippo CMS was very appealing to us. We are convinced
                                              that our find ability in search engines and our internal and
                                              external information exchange will improve by our choice for

              <p>Levi9, specialized in building, managing and
                                              testing IT applications, meanwhile has set up a large competence
                                              center of intensively trained developers in Serbia, that can
                                              implement the Hippo content management system (CMS). The Serbian
                                              developers are mainly used by implementation partners of Hippo.
                                              Because of the available resources in Serbia, partners can deliver a
                                              product with a good price/quality ratio.</p>
                                              <p>The desire for a collaboration with Levi9 arose
                                              because the request for Hippo software kept increasing. Besides
                                              that, it becomes more and more difficult to find good high educated
                                              Hippo-developers. To concede to the implementation partners, Hippo
                                              has started 'nearshoring' through Levi9.</p>
                                              <p>Tjeerd Brenninkmeijer, CEO of Hippo: &quot;
                                              'Nearshoring' has a number of advantages over 'offshoring'. Eastern
                                              Europe is relatively near to The Netherlands. The cultural
                                              differences are limited and we do not have to cope with a difference
                                              in time zone. Furthermore, it is still easily possible to exchange
                                              knowledge with the developers at their location. Levi9 has excellent
                                              knowledge of the Eastern European market. They select the developers
                                              and make sure that the required facilities for the developers are
                                              available overthere. We are extremely content about the added value
                                              that we can offer our partners and customers thanks to
                                              Levi9.&quot;</p> <p>Bernhard van

                                              speed and flexibility of Dutch sevice providers with the reduction
                                              in costs of offshoring, works for Hippo. Thanks to our center in

                                              Hippo's open source content management system (CMS) to Lost Boys'

                                              &quot;We chose Hippo CMS because of the broad range of
                                              projects that Hippo CMS can be used for, and the usage of open
                                              standards and open source software. Because of this our developers
                                              can work with it quickly and we can deliver projects to our clients
                                              faster.&quot;</p> <p>Jeroen
                                              Verberg, CFO of Hippo: &quot;We are happy that Lost Boys
                                              chose our open source CMS system. We have been working together now
                                              for a while, and have carried out several projects in a successful
                                              way. We see this as an acknowledgment of the advantages of an open
                                              source CMS. We hope that with this official confirmation of our
                                              collaboration, many more projects will follow in the
                                              future.&quot;</p>

              <p>ROC Eindhoven was looking for a CMS to make
                                              internal information spread over the more than twenty schools and
                                              seventeen locations, available and comprehensible for all employees.
                                              ROC Eindhoven chose for Hippo's CMS after an extensive selection
                                              procedure. Crucial for the final choice where the price/quality
                                              ratio, the user-friendliness, the possibility to develop
                                              applications themselves as a ROC and the use of open standards.
                                              Since the data exchange takes place through the open XML-standard,
                                              news items for instance can easily be reused for various publication
                                              channels.</p> <p>To begin with, the more
                                              than 1500 employees of ROC Eindhoven will start using the intranet,
                                              based on the Hippo CMS. In a later stage, also for the website the
                                              Hippo CMS will be used. Here information from one CMS will be reused
                                              for multiple channels. Through the intranet, employees can find
                                              information about the schools and services and about various running
                                              projects. Also, they can easily provide articles themselves for the
                                              intranet or look for the contact information or knowledge chart of
                                              colleagues in the 'smoelenboek'.</p>

                                              ROC Eindhoven also uses the <a

                                              Portal</a>. The portal gives employees the opportunity
                                              to personalize their intranet and makes using the intranet more
                                              interactive. For instance they can save their favorites, the history
                                              is saved and people can choose which sources of information appear
                                              on their own startpage.</p> <p>Harry
                                              Orbons of the IT-department of ROC Eindhoven: &quot;Our
                                              organization exists out of twenty-three schools and seven services
                                              plus a Board of Directors. Therefore it was difficult to make all
                                              internal information that was present at the different parts of the
                                              organization, comprehensible for everybody. To make the information
                                              of the ROC easier to find and more accesible, we were looking for a
                                              good content management system for our intranet site. Finally, we
                                              chose Hippo CMS. The most important reason for this choice, were the
                                              attractive price/quality ratio and the use of open source and open
                                              standards. Althought the implementation was a lengthy process and
                                              didn't always go as smoothly, since the intranet site is being used,
                                              we now already had a lot of positive reactions about the
                                              user-friendliness and the comprehensibility of the
                                              information.&quot;</p> <p>Tjeerd
                                              Brenninkmeijer, CEO of Hippo: &quot;The challenge was to
                                              present the large amount of information that is present within ROC
                                              Eindhoven, in a way that is synoptic for the user. Now the
                                              possibilities to personalize ensure that users don't get lost in the
                                              abundance of information.&quot;</p>

                                              thanks to an intensive cooperation with the developers in the Apache

                                              nomination shows that open source is growing. Our growth in turnover
                                              shows that open source can go hand in hand with a healthy commercial

                                              <p>ICT environments within the Netherlands are known
                                              for their large diversity on closed legacy systems. The closed
                                              nature of these systems make digital interaction with citizens
                                              harder. </p> <p>The Dutch government is
                                              aware of these problems. That is why she started the program Open
                                              Source Software and Open Standards (OSSOS) in 2002. The purpose of
                                              this program is to stimulate open source packages. From 2006 on,
                                              Open Standards will become obligatory. The Open Standards, for a
                                              large part XML, can assure that also legacy applications can
                                              exchange data in the near future. A prerequisite for digital
                                              provision of services. </p> <p>Within
                                              travelling branches, very valuable supplements have been encountered
                                              by combining different legacy travelling applications with the XML
                                              application framework Apache Cocoon (part of the Hippo CMS).
                                              </p> <p>Hippo is the leading specialist
                                              regarding Apache Cocoon in the Netherlands, and has the only native
                                              XML package on the Dutch market. </p>
