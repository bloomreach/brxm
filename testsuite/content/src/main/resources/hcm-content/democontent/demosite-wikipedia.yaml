              '''International Atomic Time''' ('''[http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html TAI]''', from the [[French language|French]] name '''Temps Atomique International''') is a high-precision atomic [[time standard]] that tracks [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].  It is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]], and the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. [[As of 2007]], TAI is exactly 33 seconds ahead of UTC: an initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 23 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972.<ref>ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat</ref> At the end of the 31 December 2008, a leap second will be added to UTC, leaving TAI 34 seconds ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/time/leapseconds.html |title=December 2008 leap second}}</ref>

              Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since.

              TAI as a [[frequency]] standard is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 [[atomic clock]]s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using satellites (see [http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/clock_comparisons.html BIPM clock comparisons]).  Many of these are [[caesium]] atomic clocks, which are the standard by which the [[SI]] [[second]] is defined.  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone.

              The participating institutions each broadcast in [[real time]] a frequency signal with [[time code]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  (Actually the time codes are usually published in the form of UTC.)  The better laboratories' signals are mutually synchronised to within less than 10<sup>-7</sup> s, but there are outliers up to 10<sup>-5</sup> s out.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''TAI(NPL)'' (''UTC(NPL)'' for the UTC form), where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  Some laboratories also publish their own atomic time scale, denoted in the form ''TA(USNO)'' (''USNO'' identifies the [[United States Naval Observatory]]).

              The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(x) and TAI-TA(x), for each participating institution x.

              Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).  See the article on TT for more information.

              Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL).  The first formalised atomic time scale was the ''A.1'' scale defined by USNO in 1959.  A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) at the [[UT2]] instant JD 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) as calculated at USNO.  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several [[centisecond]]s.  A.1 was extrapolated backwards to 1956.

              In 1961, the [[Bureau International de l'Heure]] (BIH) (later superseded by the BIPM and the IERS) constructed an atomic time scale named ''AM'' based on three atomic clocks.  The clocks were compared by listening to radio [[time signal]]s based on them.  The BIH's time scale was synchronised with A.1's epoch, and extrapolated back to 1955 using time signals from the first caesium clock at NPL.  This time scale was soon renamed from AM to ''A3''.

              Also in 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximates [[UT1]].  This was a [[compromise]] arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.

              In 1967 the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock.

              More clocks were added to the A3 time scale from 1967, and it was renamed to ''TA''.  Finally in 1971 it was renamed ''TAI''.

              In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the [[altitude]]s of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10<sup>-12</sup>.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').

              The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1977-01-01T00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.

              In the 1990s, annual periodic variations in the rate of some clocks were traced to [[blackbody radiation]] that varies with the ambient [[temperature]].  It became clear that a correction for this was required.  Accordingly, in 1997 the BIPM declared that the definition of the SI second referred to a caesium atom at rest and at [[absolute zero]] temperature.  Temperature corrections were implemented in TAI from 1995 to 1998, speeding TAI up by about 10<sup>-14.3</sup>.

              '''Altruism''' is selfless concern for the [[Quality of life|welfare]]\
              \ of others. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures, and central\
              \ to many religious traditions. This idea was often described as the\
              \ [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule of ethics]].  Altruism is the opposite\
              \ of [[selfishness]].\n\nAltruism can be distinguished from feelings\
              \ of [[loyalty]] and [[duty]]. Altruism focuses on a motivation to help\
              \ others or a want to do [[good and evil|good]] without reward, while\
              \ duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (for\

              \ example, a [[government]]), or an abstract concept (for example, [[patriotism]]\
              \ etc). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others\
              \ may not. Pure altruism is giving without regard to reward or the benefits\
              \ of recognition. \n\nThe concept has a long history in [[philosophical]]\

              \ to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit, then it is\
              \ not an altruistically motivated act. There are several different perspectives\
              \ on how \"benefit\" (or \"interest\") should be defined. A material\
              \ gain (for example, money, a physical reward, etc.) is clearly a form\
              \ of benefit, while others identify and include both material and immaterial\
              \ gains (affection, respect, happiness, satisfaction etc.) as being\
              \ philosophically identical benefits.  Knox (1999) ultimately argues\
              \ that \"Altruistic volunteers are either not truly altruistic or not\
              \ rational\"\n\nFor illustration of this, Knox (1999) describes circumstances\
              \ which he terms as \"the volunteers folly\". In his example a lawyer\
              \ volunteers his time on the weekends to help build low cost housing\
              \ - professing that his motivation to do so is to help provide housing\
              \ for the needy.  However, Knox identifies that this is not the proper\
              \ way for a lawyer to serve that particular interest. Since the lawyer's\
              \ work as a lawyer generates far more money than his work on the building\
              \ site is worth, Knox suggests that he should simply put in more work\
              \ as a lawyer and donate the proceeds of that work. This would serve\
              \ his professed purpose to a higher degree, since that money would afford\
              \ the project several times more work than he himself could provide\
              \ to the project directly.<ref name=\"knox\">Knox, Trevor, ''The Volunteer's\
              \ Folly and Socio-Economic Man: Some Thoughts On Altruism, Rationality,\

              \nSome may find this logic disagreeable or counterintuitive as an ideation\
              \ of altruism, because it seems to require that martyrdom — or fatal\
              \ sacrifice for a greater cause — be the only actualization of altruism.\n\
              \nPsychological egoism can be accused of using [[circular logic]]. \
              \ For instance, an egoist would not disagree with the following [[syllogism]]:\
              \ \"If a person has willingly performed an act, then he/she has manifested\
              \ such intent in the form of that act.  Fulfillment of one's desires\
              \ is the primary requisite of satisfaction.  Ergo, a person can only\
              \ willingly perform acts that result in his/her personal enjoyment.\"\
              \  This logic is sometimes viewed as circular or presumptuous.  Specifically,\
              \ egoism leans on the assumption that satisfaction is synonymous with\
              \ self-satisfaction.  Such a precept automatically sidesteps counterpoint,\
              \ however, and remains [[unfalsifiable]].  Thus, until [[empirical evidence]]\
              \ favors one view or the other, egoism must acquiesce to [[uncertainty]].\
              \ \n\nHumans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members,\
              \ previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic\
              \ towards people they don't know and will never meet. For example, some\
              \ humans donate to international [[Charitable organization|charities]]\
              \ and volunteer their time to help [[society]]'s less fortunate. It\
              \ can however be argued that an individual would contribute to a charity\
              \ to gain respect or stature within his/her own community.\n \nBeginning\
              \ with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living\
              \ in a benign universe, logically it follows that particular human beings\
              \ may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive\
              \ to make the world a better place."

              Digital altruism is one of the major user motivations for contributing to virtual communities such as [[social media]], [[social learning]] and other web sites which feature user-generated content. It is related to the basic human need to contribute to a greater good, outside of the market-space and free of self-interest. The digital nature of this motivation is important because, thanks to the combination of new technologies that facilitate de-localized communication and new web sites which make contributing easy, fun and rewarding, altruistic needs can be more easily balanced with self-interested responsibilities (work, family, leisure).

              In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behavior), and more\
              \ generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to\
              \ behavior by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]\
              \ of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.{{Fact|date=December\

              \ been ideologically opposed to the [[social darwinism|social darwinist]]\
              \ concept of the \"[[survival of the fittest]]\", under the name of\
              \ \"survival of the nicest\"&mdash;the latter being globally compatible,\
              \ however, with [[darwinism|darwinist]]' [[theory of evolution]]. Insistence\
              \ on such cooperative behaviours between animals was first exposed by\
              \ the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902\
              \ book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]''.\n\nRecent developments\
              \ in [[game theory]] (see [[ultimatum game]]) have provided some explanations\
              \ for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses.\
              \ Among the proposed mechanisms are:\n\n* Behavioural manipulation (for\

              \ of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development\
              \ of the [[Price equation]] which is a mathematical equation used to\
              \ study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found\
              \ in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]]\
              \ mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until\
              \ starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting\
              \ body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival\
              \ of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism\
              \ share many similarities to the interactions between the many parts\
              \ (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability\
              \ of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement\
              \ for its neighbors.\n\nJorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists\
              \ at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network\

              \ reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights\

              \ attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment\

              \ by some as breathing new life into the model of [[group selection]]\
              \ for Altruism, known as \"Survival of the nicest\". Bowles conducted\
              \ a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups, including [[Australian\
              \ aboriginals]], native [[Siberian]] [[Inuit]] populations and indigenous\
              \ tribal groups in Africa. It was found that [[hunter-gatherer]] bands\
              \ of up to 30 individuals were considerably more closely related than\
              \ was previously thought.  Under these conditions, thought to be similar\
              \ to those of the middle and upper [[Paleolithic]], altruism towards\
              \ other group-members would improve the overall fitness of the group.\
              \ \n\nIf an individual defended the group but was killed, any genes\
              \ that the individual shared with the overall group would still be passed\
              \ on.  Early customs such as food sharing or [[monogamy]] could have\
              \ levelled out the “cost” of altruistic behaviour, in the same way that\
              \ income taxes redistribute income in society. He assembled genetic,\
              \ climactic, archaeological, ethnographic and experimental data to examine\
              \ the cost-benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations.\
              \  In his model, members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour\
              \ pay a \"tax\" by limiting their reproductive opportunities to benefit\
              \ from sharing food and information, thereby increasing the average\
              \ fitness of the group as well as their inter-relatedness. Bands of\
              \ altruistic humans would then act together to gain resources from other\

              \ of the world's [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important\
              \ moral value. [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]]\
              \ place particular emphasis on altruistic morality, as noted above,\
              \ but [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]] and many other religions also promote\
              \ altruistic behavior. \n\nAltruism was central to the teachings of\
              \ [[Jesus]] found in the [[Gospel]] especially in the [[Sermon on the\
              \ Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval\
              \ [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard\
              \ were sometimes discussed under the heading of \"disinterested love,\"\
              \ as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase \"love seeks not its\
              \ own interests.\" In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception'',\
              \ Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting\
              \ them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by\
              \ analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self,\
              \ and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. If love,\
              \ which confirms others in their freedom, shuns propagandas and masks,\
              \ assurance of its presence is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations\
              \ from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within.\
              \ As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love become validated\
              \ and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the doing.\n\
              \nThough it might seem obvious that altruism is central to the teachings\
              \ of Jesus, one important and influential strand of Christianity would\
              \ qualify this. [[St Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'',\
              \ I:II Quaestion 26, Article 4 states that we should love ourselves\
              \ more than our neighbour. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase\
              \ is that we should seek the common good more than the private good\
              \ but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the\
              \ individual. 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from [[Leviticus]]\
              \ 19 and Matthew 22 is interpreted by St Thomas as meaning that love\
              \ for ourself is the exemplar of love for others. He does think though,\
              \ that we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbour, taken\
              \ as an entirety, more than our bodily life, since the ultimate purpose\
              \ of love of our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude, a more\
              \ desirable thing than bodily well being. Comte was probably opposing\
              \ this Thomistic doctrine, now part of mainstream Catholicism, in coining\
              \ the word Altruism, as stated above."

              \ by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought\
              \ Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action\
              \ that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.\n\
              \"What were you doing, and why?\" asked the Guru. \"I was giving water\
              \ to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,\" replied Bhai\
              \ Kanhaiya. \nThe Guru responded, \"Then you should also give them ointment\
              \ to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in\
              \ the house of the Guru.\" \n\nIt was under the tutelage of the Guru\
              \ that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism.\
              \ This volunteer corps till to date is engaged in doing good to others\
              \ and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.\n\nIt is\
              \ claimed by some Sikhs that Bhai Kanhaiya's successors who continued\
              \ the tradition of serving others and who committed their lives to service\
              \ of the sick and wounded lived longer than usual life spans.{{Fact|date=January\
              \ 2008}} Bhai Kanhaiya’s successors were not related genetically in\
              \ order to account for their exceptional longevity. Rather they were\
              \ volunteers from the Sikh organizations who committed their lives to\
              \ serve the sick; first they did it themselves and then they recruited\
              \ others to do the same. All of them defied the recorded longevity norms\
              \ of the time for a long span of over three centuries.{{Fact|date=January\
              \ 2008}}\n\nLongevity is determined by many factors, freedom from disease\
              \ and stress are two such factors. The altruists were certainly observed\
              \ to live calm and tranquil lives. For Sikhs, altruism was made an act\
              \ of faith by their founders.\n <!-- This section should continue by\
              \ quoting altruism-related verses from the holy books of the aforementioned\
              \ religions -->"
