        intranet:summary: For a 10% fuel consumption reduction...
        intranet:title: Toyota suggests putting a glass of water on your dash (well,
          not really)

            <p>No, Toyota isn't trying to con you into buying a "water powered car". They
            are simply trying to illustrate a simple point about fuel-efficient driving
            that, sadly, too few people seem to know: If you drive smoothly and try to avoid
            abrupt acceleration and deceleration as much as possible, you'll save fuel. It's
            sound advice (of course, use your judgement and don't put saving fuel above
            driving safely and sanely), and a good way to get a "feel" for that kind of
            driving is to imagine that there's a glass of water on your dash (or use
            Toyota's virtual water glass iPhone app) or an egg between the gas pedal and
            your foot (sorry, no app for that). Even better if you have a fuel economy gauge
            that shows you real time consumption. This doesn't mean you should drive slowly
            in traffic, but when appropriate, you can save a lot of gas (and CO2) by being a
            smooth operator.</p>

        intranet:summary: This week’s record-breaking night flight by the Solar Impulse
          aircraft has been widely acclaimed, but few of us are ever likely to fly
          in such a plane.

            <p>Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard, the initiator of the project, pilot André
            Borschberg, and the host of designers and developers who made the flight
            possible may have entered the history books, but what does their achievement
            mean in practical terms? <br/>
            “I hope that in two years time at the next Green Aviation Show we shall be able
            to give a prize to the hero of the day, Bertrand Piccard,” Gerard Feldzer,
            director of the Air and Space Museum at Paris’ Le Bourget airport, told
            swissinfo.ch <br/>
            Feldzer, who has known Piccard for many years, is an expert on
            environmentally-friendly aircraft. He points out though that Solar Impulse is
            not the first plane of its type. <br/>
            The Green Aviation Show awarded for example its 2010 prize to Eric Raymond – who
            first crossed the United States in <br/>
            a solar-powered plane 20 years ago. <br/>
            The difference was that Raymond made his flight in one-hour hops, Feldzer
            explained.</p>

            <p><strong>Twice the size, ten times the problems</strong></p>

            <p>“The technique is no different, but Piccard’s achievement is to build a big
            enough plane. When you double the size, that doesn’t mean you have twice the
            number of problems. You have ten times the problems.” <br/>
            On the one hand the structural challenge is much more complex – supporting the
            giant wing, and transmitting and storing the energy, for example. <br/>
            But a long flight is a human challenge too. <br/>
            “You have to be able sit still, take tiny snatches of sleep… It’s like a space
            flight, or even worse. You can’t move… Everything has to be within reach.”
            <br/>
            It would have been possible to fly a solar-powered drone across the Atlantic
            long ago, Feldzer explained; having a person on board “changes everything”.</p>

            <p>This week, the Public Broadcasting Service aired a NOVA program titled

            decade.</p>

            <p>Fossil fuels burnt in factories and automobiles send their waste into our
            atmosphere in two forms. The first is CO2 and other greenhouse gases, which have
            received substantial attention in the last few years because of the way they
            trap heat in the atmosphere. The second is the tiny particles of sulfur dioxide,
            soot and ash, which scientists call aerosols (basically smog). Research into
            understanding the negative health effects of air pollution has resulted in the
            development of catalytic converters for cars as well as devices to remove
            particulate solids from industrial waste before it reaches the air.</p>
