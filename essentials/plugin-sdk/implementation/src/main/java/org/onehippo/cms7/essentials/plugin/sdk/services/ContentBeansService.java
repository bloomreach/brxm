/**
 * ContentBeansService provides support for updating the project's (HST) content beans, to be used typically after
 * an action that altered one of more document types of your project.
 *
 * TODO: this API doesn't feel right yet, and therefore continues to live in the SDK implementation for the time being.
 * The problem mostly evolves around different representations of an image set: JCR nodetype, classname, bean path.
 * We should converge to a single imageset "ID" used consistently in the API, potentially augmented with an image set
 * data bean providing additional information about an image set to the user of the API.
 *
 * The current users, the BeanWriter and the GalleryManager, hence keep depending on the SDK implementation for now.
