            <p>Rebuilding the project is required for the following plugins:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item" ng-repeat="plugin in REBUILD_PLUGINS">

        <h3>Build instructions</h3>
        <p>
            In order to activate the changes you made, you need to rebuild and restart your project. You need to do
            this in a command line terminal. Please follow the instructions below to do so. You will be able to
            continue setting up your Hippo CMS or BloomReach Experience project after a successful rebuild.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain features require you to rebuild and restart twice in order to have them fully installed into your
            project. Essentials will indicate this. After rebuilding, you will be directed to the page
            <em>Installed features</em>, so you can configure the features you installed.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            You don't need to rebuild for every single feature you add to the project, it is sufficient to rebuild
            after you added a batch of features.
        </div>
        <p>Step 1: In your terminal, stop the running project by pressing Ctrl-C.</p>
        <p>Step 2: In the root folder of your project, issue the following command to rebuild the project:</p>
    <pre>
mvn verify</pre>
        <p>Step 3: To start your project locally, issue the following command from the project root directory:</p>
    <pre>
mvn -Pcargo.run -Drepo.path=storage</pre>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>By default, the repository content is stored in the directory target/storage. This has the effect that,
                when you run "mvn clean", the repository content, along with all unexported changes you made during
                development, is erased. To avoid accidents in this area, it is a best practice to specify a different
                location for storing the repository, outside the target directory. This is expressed by the repo.path
                parameter in the command above.</p>
