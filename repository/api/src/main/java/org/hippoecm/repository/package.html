    This package provides a factory class to obtain access to a Hippo repository.

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
    The Hippo repository is essentially a JSR-183 compliant Java Content
    Repository (JCR).  In case of stand-alone applications or when no JNDI
    reference is available, the HippoRepositoryFactory has static methods to
    obtain a connection to a repsoitory.  This is based on a URL, allowing you
    to start a new local repository, or connect remotely to an existing
    repository instance.  The returned repository from this factory is an
    instance of HippoRepository which contains a few convience calls for
    transaction control and logging in.  The actual JCR repository is returned
    using the call to HippoRepository.getRepository().  Whether you use the
    HippoRepository class iself or immediately get the javax.jcr.Repository
    class, you will find yourself with an authenticated javax.jcr.Session
    object.
    </p>

    <p>
    You should however be aware that there are a number of extensions the
    Hippo Repository has on top of the JCR specification.  Because these calls
    cannot be integrated into the JCR interfaces, you should be aware that the
    following extensions exist:
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Any {@link javax.jcr.Node} can also be cast to a
    {@link org.hippoecm.repository.api.HippoNode}, which contains a number of
    extensions related to handling JCR nodes.
    A {@link javax.jcr.Session} obtained by logging in can be cast to a
    {@link org.hippoecm.repository.api.HippoSession}, containing exensions
    related to changes in a systemSession context.
    Finally, {@link javax.jcr.Workspace} instances may be cast to the
    {@link org.hippoecm.repository.api.HippoWorkspace} interface allowing
    access to some additional services such as the
    {@link org.hippoecm.repository.api.WorkflowManager}.
