/**
 * A workflow is a set of procedures that can be performed on a document in the repository.  These procedures can be
 * accessed by obtaining a Workflow implementation from the {@link WorkflowManager}.  Calling a method that is defined
 * by an interface extending the {@link Workflow} interface causes such a workflow step (procedure) to be executed.
 * Which workflow is active on a document depends amongst others on the type of document.  Therefor the {@link Workflow}
 * interface itself defines no workflow actions, but any {@link Workflow} instance should be cast to a document-specific
 * interface. The implementation of these document-specific workflows can be provided at run-time to the repository.
 * Therefor there is no standard set of workflows available.  There are a number of  commonly available workflows, but
 * these are not mandatory.  See all known sub-interfaces of the {@link Workflow} interface, or
 * org.hippoecm.repository.standardworkflow.FolderWorkflow for an example.
 * <p/>
 * Implementors of this interface should never return subclasses of the {@link Document} class in their interface.  It
 * is allowed to return an instance of a subclass of a {@link Document}, but the repository will force recreating the
 * object returned as a direct instance of an {@link Document}.
