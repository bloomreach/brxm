/**
 * Use this annotation on implementations of {@link DaemonModule}s to
 * inform the system about which services it uses from the
 * {@link org.onehippo.cms7.services.HippoServiceRegistry}
 * and which are provided by other {@link DaemonModule}s.
 * Together with the {@link ProvidesService} annotation, this annotation
 * determines the order in which modules are started (and destroyed because that
 * happens in reversed order).
 * <p>
 *   The optional optional attribute informs the system not to fail loading the module in the absence of the service.
 *   I.e. if there is no module that provides the service.
 *   If you specify the optional attribute it needs to be an array of booleans that is equal in length to the array
 *   of types that is specified in the types attribute.
