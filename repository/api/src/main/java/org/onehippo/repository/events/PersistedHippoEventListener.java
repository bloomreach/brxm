/**
 * Developers can implement this interface to asynchronously receive
 * {@link HippoEvent HippoEvents} after they occurred in the repository, across a repository cluster.
 * <p>
 *   Such a listener must be registered through the {@link PersistedHippoEventListenerRegistry}, like for example:
 *   <pre>
 *   <code>
 *       PersistedHippoEventListenerRegistry.get().register(myPersistedHippoEventListener);
 *   </code>
 *   </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   A PersistedHippoEventListener must provide a (cluster node instance unique) channel name which will be used to
 *   track which persisted events already have been delivered to the listener.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   A listener will get a consistent and ordered delivery of all events within a specific {@link #getEventCategory()}
 *   (or all if unspecified) through that channel, but such events
 *   will only be delivered <em>once</em> (within one cluster node) through that channel.<br/>
 *   <em>Therefore there should only be one listener (registered) per channel per cluster node.</em><br/>
 *   If more than one listener is registered on one channel, only one will get the events delivered!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   A listener also has to define through {@link #onlyNewEvents()} if it should receive persisted events even from before
 *   the first time registration on its {@link #getChannelName() channel} (for as much is looked back in time,
 *   depending on the service configuration), or only events after the first time channel registration will be delivered.
 * </p>
