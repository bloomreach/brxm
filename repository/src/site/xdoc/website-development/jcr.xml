      <section name="Website Development">
        <p>
          After having set up your ECM, you may very well want to publish the contents
          of the repository by means of a website. This means that your website has to connect to
          the repository. As the repository is Java Content Repository (JCR) compliant,
          Java clients using this standard can communicate with the repository.
          Besides that, Hippo has developed a library on top of the JCR layer
          that is called the <code>Hippo Site Toolkit</code>, which is targeted at JSP clients,
          for easy website development, see the <a href="index.html">Hippo Site Toolkit</a>.
        </p>

        <subsection name="The JCR Interface">
          <p>
            The Hippo Repository provides a standard Java Content Repository (JCR) interface that is also known
            as <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170" target="_blank">Java Specification Request 170</a>.
            It uses an <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr-api.html" target="_blank">Apache JackRabbit</a> implementation.
            The JCR interface is also mentioned in the example under <a href="/integrate-hippo-ecm/example.html">Integrating Hippo ECM</a>,
            which was applicable for extending the CMS interface.</p>
          <p>A Java client that wants to use the interface must retrieve a <code>javax.jcr.Session</code> object.
             A static factory class is available to help with that. A simple example on how to connect and login
             to a Hippo Repository based on location, user name and password is:
          </p>
          <source><![CDATA[  HippoRepository repository
      = HippoRepositoryFactory.getHippoRepository("rmi://localhost:1099/hipporepository");
  javax.jcr.Session session = repository.login(<userName>, <password>);
  session.getRootNode()  etc..]]></source>
