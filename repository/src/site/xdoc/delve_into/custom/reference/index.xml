      <span class="shortdesc">Technical documentation on add-on development.</span>

      <p>
        Add-ons are collections of plugins. Plugins come in various shapes and sizes.
        This section gives in-depth background information.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Repository plugins vs. frontend plugins">

        <p>
          One class of plugins, even though
          configured and stored in the repository only affects the front-end
          application.  It can define additional GUI elements, different look and feel,
          new functionality, etcetera.  However these components are not supposted to
          perform serious data transformations or computations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another class of plugins perform processing and implements business logic.
          These plugins define logic to be executed in the repository upon events,
          triggers or explicit invocation by a front-end application.
        </p>  
        <p>  
          Because these plugins are either expose themselves to a front-end application,
          or perform data mapping which is also available outside of the repository,
          there is a third class of plugin.
          This third class of plugin should not contain any executable code, but defines
          interfaces and data-mappings, such that a repository based plugin can
          talk to a plugin that is pure front-end.
          <!-- FIXME
          At this time, add-ons consist of
          only only front-end plugins (the front-end application is a single add-on
          itself), or consist of the three classes of plugins.
          At M3, there will also be addons that are pure repository plugins.
          -->
        </p>

        <p>
          The classes of plugins are explained in the following subsections:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <a href="repository/repository_plugins.html">Repository and interface plugins</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                Business logic and their interfaces.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <a href="frontend/index.html">Frontend plugins</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                Pure GUI plugins.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </blockquote>
