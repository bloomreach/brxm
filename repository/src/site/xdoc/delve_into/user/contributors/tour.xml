  <section name="Hippo CMS Authors Tour">
   <span class='shortdesc'>
    A CMS author writes documents and can upload images and
    other binaries (this is why they are sometimes called 'contributors').
    To get introduced to the role of CMS author, take the following tour.
   </span>

    <p>
     Screenshot of the online word-processor of the Hippo CMS.
     In the <a href='../screenshots.html'>screenshots in the guide</a>,
     you may double click to make it as large
     as possible and single click to show the relevant part.
     This is useful if the relevant part is small.
    </p>
   </div>

     <p>To get introduced to the role of CMS <a href='./concepts/contributor.html'>author</a>,
        you will look over the shoulder of Marc,
        who is a member of the imaginary organization Swatia,
        an organization of people very interested in music, art and knowledge. We did not imagine an
        answer to the question whether Swatia is a commercial organization, a hobby organization, or both.
    </p>
    <p>Swatia decided to publish an online newspaper about music, art and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>Marc will add an article about an upcoming multicultural Bazaar.
    </p>

         Marc opens the Hippo CMS site of Swatia. He needed to know the
         site's web address and he got it from the CMS administrator,
         who got it from the system administrator
         who installed the Hippo CMS at Swatia.

        To login to the CMS,
        Marc types his username and password in the appropriate inputfields.
        His password is supposed to be only known to him, so you do not get to see it.

         He gives it the <a href='./concepts/document_type.html'>document type</a> 'upcoming',

         indoors. Marc knows that the bazaar is not indoors and he adds that information
         in the document.
         He also is supposed to answer the question whether the happening is
         a recurring happening, i.e. a happening that has occurred before.
         This is the case, so Marc also adds that information to the document.

         writes an informative text about the upcoming multicultural bazaar.
         He includes the place where the bazaar will be in this description,
