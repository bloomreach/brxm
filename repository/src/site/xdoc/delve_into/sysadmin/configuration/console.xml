  <section name="Console">
   <span class='shortdesc'>A simple GUI application that can be used to edit the configuration.</span>
   <p>
    The console application provides a simple interface to browse
    the repository and edit its contents.  Most of the configuration
    is accessible this way, see the
    <a href="nodes/index.html">Configuration Nodes</a> page for more
    details on what can be found where.
  </p>

        <p>
          The console can normally be found under
          <a href="http://localhost:8080/cms/console">http://localhost:8080/cms/console</a>.
          It actually depends on your configuration. It might be http://localhost:8080/console.

        </p>
        <p>
          The application is based on the concept of "the selected node".  This is
          the JCR node that is selected in the tree.  The main panel shows
          properties and node type information and allows you to edit those.
          The menu operations are also based on this node:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li><code>Add Node:</code> adds a child node</li>
            <li><code>Delete Node:</code> deletes the node</li>
            <li><code>Move Node:</code> move the node</li>
            <li><code>Copy Node:</code> copy the node</li>
            <li><code>Rename Node:</code> rename the node</li>
            <li><code>Export Node:</code> export to XML</li>
            <li><code>Add Property:</code> add a property to the node</li>
            <li><code>Save:</code> save the node and its descendants</li>
            <li><code>Reset:</code> reset the node and its descendants</li>
          </ol>
