How to test and build Hippo Repository
========================================

1. Introduction

  Very brief introduction to how to build and test Hippo Repository!

2. Requirements --

  (1) Java 1.8
  (2) Maven 3.0.4+

3. Build 
     
    (1) Build with short running test but no integration tests
    
      $ mvn clean install
    
    (2) Build with skipping tests
    
      $ mvn clean install -DskipTests
    
    (3) Build with integration tests

      $ mvn clean install -Pintegration

    (4) Build with Hippo Snapshot Repository Flag
      - Note: Mostly you do not need this when you check out and build a released version!
              Needed only when you build the TRUNK having snapshot dependencies!
      - Note: Please beware that the `-Dhippo.snapshots' option is effective only when you define
              a Maven profile with this property in your settings.xml for the Hippo snapshot repository.
              For detail, see https://wiki.onehippo.com/display/CMS7/Build+Hippo+CMS+7.5+or+higher+from+scratch
      - Add `-Dhippo.snapshots' for snapshot dependencies.
        For example,
        
          $ mvn clean install -Dhippo.snapshots -DskipTests
