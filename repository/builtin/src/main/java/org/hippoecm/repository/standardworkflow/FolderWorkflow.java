/**
 * Work-flow interface that is generally available on container documents.  Container documents are documents that contain
 * a set of other documents and are most of the time themselves content-free.  Two default container documents are folders
 * and directories, which are mostly the same except for the fact that the entries in directories do not have an ordering, while
 * entries in a folder are ordered.  The work-flow interface FolderWorkflow is returned by methods in the WorkflowManager when
 * passed a container document as argument.
 * <p>
 * The arguments map that can be passed to add, copy and move operations allow you perform rewrite rules upon the document being
 * handled.  For each relative path specified as key in the map, if defines the new value to be used instead of the original
 * value in the prototype or source document that is being copied or moved.  Relative paths may start with <code>./</code> and
 * the pseudo names _name and _node refer to the name of the node actually being copied and _node to any child node.  To set a
 * property x to any document variant of a node being copied, you would use the relative path <code>./_name/_node/x</code>.
 * The new value of the property --or in case it refers to a node, the new node name-- becomes the value in the map.  There
 * are a number of symbolic values that are allowed in the map, which are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>$inherit</code> the value under the same path in the parent document</li>
 * <li><code>$now</code> substitutes with the current datetime</li>
 * <li><code>$holder</code> replaced by the user id of the original user invoking the workflow</li>
 * <li><code>$uuid</code> a uniquely generated UUID</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that the add work-flow methods return an absolute path to a document handle (a JCR node of type hippo:handle), while
 * a org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document would have been more appropriate.
