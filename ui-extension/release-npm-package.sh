# Releases the UI extension package on NPM central.
#
# Requirements:
# - NPM user account (see https://www.npmjs.com/login)
# - NPM user should be part of the @bloomreach organization (see https://www.npmjs.com/settings/bloomreach/members)
#
# BE CAREFUL:
# - A released package can be un-released with "npm unpublish @bloomreach/ui-extension@<version>"
# - This can only be done within 72 hours after publishing
# - PUBLISHED VERSIONS CAN NEVER BE REUSED AGAIN, so publishing again needs to increase the patch version.

# Ensure that this script fails fast on any npm error
