The Maven build generates documentation from sources in AsciiDoc:

    $ mvn
    
The resulting HTML file can be viewed in a browser:

    target/channel-manager-guidebook.html

The AsciiDoc source can also be previewed in IntelliJ using the AsciiDoc plugin.
PlantUML diagrams are only generated when [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org) is installed.
