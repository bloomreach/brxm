# Channel Manager's User Interface (Angular based)

This project is intended to replace the current outdated frontend application based on angular.js located
in the **frontend-ng** folder. During the transition period new functionality and replacements will be provided
by this project via [Angular elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements). On the latter steps this project should
take over more functionality and eventually replace angular.js based application completely.

## Code scaffolding

## Build
