The channel manager allows a webmaster to manage multiple channels inside the CMS

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

 - Java 7
 - Maven 3.x
 - Node Package Manager (http://npmjs.org)
 - Grunt (http://gruntjs.org)
 - Bower (http://bower.io)

Grunt and Bower can be installed with Node Package Manager:

 $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower

If Bower fails to download zipped dependencies, make sure it uses decompress-zip >= 0.0.4.
(e.g. check the file /usr/lib/node_modules/bower/node_modules/decompress-zip/package.json,
and reinstall Bower if decompress-zip is too old).

-----------------------------
Windows specific instructions
-----------------------------

You can automate the installation of NPM using Chocolatey package manager:
https://chocolatey.org/

The package for Node.js can be installed using:
cinst nodejs.install

Then install Bower and Grunt with NPM as explained before. Due to an open issue with Maven
exec plugin [1], you will have to either copy or rename the Bower and Grunt .cmd files to
.bat extension:
C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd -> npm.bat
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\bower.cmd -> bower.bat
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\grunt.cmd -> grunt.bat

Build
-----

Build with testing:

 $ mvn clean install

Build without testing:

 $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

Build with snapshot dependencies:

 $ mvn clean install -Dhippo.snapshots

 Note: only needed when the project refers to SNAPSHOT dependencies!

 Note: only effective when your Maven settings.xml file contains a profile
       with this property for the Hippo snapshot repository. For details, see
       http://www.onehippo.org/7_8/library/development/build-hippo-cms-from-scratch.html

Develop AngularJS UI with live reload
-------------------------------------

Some UI parts in the 'frontend' module are build with AngularJS. The client-side
dependencies are fetched with Bower. Grunt takes care of building the AnguluarJS
sources, and copies files from frontend/js into the Maven target folder.

Grunt can also watch the AngularJS sources for changes, and reload the AngularJS
application automatically while the CMS is running. To make this happen:

 1. Build the channel manager with JRebel:

    $ mvn clean install -Djrebel

 2. Let Grunt watch the sources

    $ cd frontend
    $ grunt watch

 3. In a second shell, start the CMS in Wicket development mode with JRebel enabled:

    $ cd <your project>
    $ mvn -Pcargo.run -Dcargo.jvm.args='-Dwicket.configuration=development' -Djrebel

Changes to AngularJS sources are then automatically picked up by Grunt, which rebuilds
the sources and copies them to the Maven target folder. Grunt will then signal the
livereload task in your browser to reload the AngularJS-based UI. Since your project
runs with JRebel, Tomcat will load the new sources in the target folder and changes
are visible directly.
