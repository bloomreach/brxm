  // CHANNELMGR-705 If an action on the page causes a scrollbar to appear/disappear, a flex element with a max-width
  // other than 100% (like 50%) will be rendered at 100% width. A browser-resize event fixes this and renders the
  // element at 50%, but that is not a pleasant solution :)
  // It is caused by flex-grow: 1; Normally, adding flex="nogrow" should be enough, but in some cases this is overridden
  // by media-query rules like 'flex-gt-xs="66"'. For these situations we need to force flex-grow: 0
