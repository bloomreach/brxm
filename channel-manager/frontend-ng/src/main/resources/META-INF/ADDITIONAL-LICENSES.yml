    ----------------------------------------------------------- SIL OPEN FONT
    LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
    -----------------------------------------------------------  PREAMBLE The
    goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development
    of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of
    academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open
    framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
    others.  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
    including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,  redistributed
    and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used
    by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
    under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under
    this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
    derivatives.  DEFINITIONS 'Font Software' refers to the set of files
    released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as
    such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation. 
    'Reserved Font Name' refers to any names specified as such after the
    copyright statement(s).  'Original Version' refers to the collection of Font
    Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).  'Modified
    Version' refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
    substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original
    Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
    environment.  'Author' refers to any designer, engineer, programmer,
    technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software. 
    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
    person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge,
    embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the
    Font Software, subject to the following conditions:  1) Neither the Font
    Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified
    Versions, may be sold by itself.  2) Original or Modified Versions of the
    Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software,
    provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this
    license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
    human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata
    fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily
    viewed by the user.  3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the
    Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the
    corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary
    font name as presented to the users.  4) The name(s) of the Copyright
    Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to
    promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge
    the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with
    their explicit written permission.  5) The Font Software, modified or
    unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this
    license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any
    document created using the Font Software.  TERMINATION This license becomes
    null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.  DISCLAIMER THE
    FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

    2004                      http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND
    CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1. Definitions.    
    'License' shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,    and

    'Object' form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical   
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but    not limited
    to compiled object code, generated documentation,    and conversions to
    other media types.     'Work' shall mean the work of authorship, whether in
    Source or    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by
    a    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work    (an
    example is provided in the Appendix below).     'Derivative Works' shall
    mean any work, whether in Source or Object    form, that is based on (or
    derived from) the Work and for which the    editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications    represent, as a whole,
    an original work of authorship. For the purposes    of this License,
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain    separable from, or
    merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,    the Work and
    Derivative Works thereof.     'Contribution' shall mean any work of
    authorship, including    the original version of the Work and any
    modifications or additions    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that
    is intentionally    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the
    copyright owner    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
    on behalf of    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
    'submitted'    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
    communication sent    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but
    not limited to    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
    control systems,    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
    behalf of, the    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the
    Work, but    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
    otherwise    designated in writing by the copyright owner as 'Not a
    Contribution.'     'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or
    Legal Entity    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by
    Licensor and    subsequently incorporated within the Work.  2. Grant of
    Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,    publicly display, publicly
    perform, sublicense, and distribute the    Work and such Derivative Works in
    Source or Object form.  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
    perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
    Work,    where such license applies only to those patent claims
    licensable    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their   
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)    with the
    Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You    institute patent
    litigation against any entity (including a    cross-claim or counterclaim in
    a lawsuit) alleging that the Work    or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct    or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses    granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate    as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the    Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without    modifications, and in Source or
    Object form, provided that You    meet the following conditions:     (a) You
    must give any other recipients of the Work or        Derivative Works a copy
    of this License; and     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry
    prominent notices        stating that You changed the files; and     (c) You
    must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works        that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and        attribution notices
    from the Source form of the Work,        excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of        the Derivative Works; and     (d) If the Work
    includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its        distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must        include a readable copy of
    the attribution notices contained        within such NOTICE file, excluding
    those notices that do not        pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one        of the following places: within a NOTICE text
    file distributed        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
    form or        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
    or,        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and       
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents        of
    the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and        do not modify
    the License. You may add Your own attribution        notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside        or as an addendum to
    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed        as modifying the License.    
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and    may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions    for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or    for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,    reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with    the conditions stated in
    this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of   
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.    Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify    the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed    with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of
    the Licensor,    except as required for reasonable and customary use in
    describing the    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
    NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law
    or    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each   
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,    WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or    implied,
    including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    of TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any    risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In
    no event and under no legal theory,    whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise,    unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
    shall any Contributor be    liable to You for damages, including any direct,
    indirect, special,    incidental, or consequential damages of any character
    arising as a    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
    the    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,   
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor    has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional
    Liability. While redistributing    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You
    may choose to offer,    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
    warranty, indemnity,    or other liability obligations and/or rights
    consistent with this    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
    may act only    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
    behalf    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,   
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability    incurred by,
    or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason    of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
    perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims
    licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
    their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
    submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
    direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4.
    Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications,
    and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following
    conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work
    or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You
    must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating
    that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source
    form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright,
    patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of
    the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
    of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a
    'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy
    of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the
    Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within
    a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with
    the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices
    normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for
    informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may
    add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
    the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot
    be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own
    copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional
    or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or
    distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works
    as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the
    Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this
    License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in
    the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
    conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or
    conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6.
    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade      
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,      
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the      
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.
    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to
    in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides
    its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without
    limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or
    redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability.
    In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in
    writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of
    any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or
    inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for
    loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
    any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such
    Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.    
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing      
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and
    charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other
    liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License.
    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own
    behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other
    Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each
    Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted
    against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such
    warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    # ASN1.js  ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.  ## Example  Define model: 
    ```javascript var asn = require('asn1.js');  var Human = asn.define('Human',
    function() {   this.seq().obj(     this.key('firstName').octstr(),    
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),     this.key('age').int(),    
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),    
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)   ); });  var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function()
    {   this.seq().obj(     this.key('time').gentime(),    
    this.key('description').octstr()   ); }); ```  Encode data:  ```javascript
    var output = Human.encode({   firstName: 'Thomas',   lastName: 'Anderson',  
    age: 28,   gender: 'male',   bio: [     {       time: +new Date('31 March
    1999'),       description: 'freedom of mind'     }   ] }, 'der'); ``` 
    Decode data:  ```javascript var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
    console.log(human); /* { firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,   lastName:
    <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,   age: 28,   gender: 'male',   bio:    [ {
    time: 922820400000,        description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f
    66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] } */ ```  ### Partial decode  Its possible to parse
    data without stopping on first error. In order to do it, you should call: 
    ```javascript var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
    console.log(human); /* { result: { ... },   errors: [ ... ] } */ ```  ####

    forEach function for JavaScript.  We don't need junky 30K async libs.
    Really.  For browsers and node.js.  ## Installation * Just include
    async-each before your scripts. * `npm install async-each` if you’re using
    node.js. * `bower install async-each` if you’re using
    [Bower](http://bower.io).  ## Usage  * `each(array, iterator, callback);` —
    `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function` * `iterator(item, next)` receives
    current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback
    receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments. * `callback(error,
    transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result
    `Array`.  Node.js:  ```javascript var each = require('async-each');
    each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {   if
    (error) console.error(error);   console.log('Contents for a, b and c:',
    contents); }); ```  Browser:  ```javascript window.asyncEach(list, fn,
    callback); ```  ## License  [The MIT

    are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of
    discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is
    conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the
    copyright owner as 'Not a Contribution.'        'Contributor' shall mean
    Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a
    Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently
    incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to
    the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
    and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
    form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
    perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims
    licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
    their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
    submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
    direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4.
    Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications,
    and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following

    the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
    of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a
    'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy
    of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the
    Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within
    a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with
    the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices
    normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for
    informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may
    add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
    the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot
    be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own
    copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional
    or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or
    distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works
    as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the
    Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this
    License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in
    the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
    conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or
    conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6.
    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade      
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,      
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the      
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.
    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to
    in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides
    its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR

    responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or
    redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability.
    In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in
    writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of
    any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or
    inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for
    loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
    any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such
    Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    # <img src='./logo.png' alt='bn.js' width='160' height='160' />  > BigNum in
    pure javascript  [![Build
    Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js) 
    ## Install `npm install --save bn.js`  ## Usage  ```js const BN =
    require('bn.js');  var a = new BN('dead', 16); var b = new BN('101010', 2); 
    var res = a.add(b); console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047 ```  **Note**:
    decimals are not supported in this library.  ## Notation  ### Prefixes 
    There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work.
    Here is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:  *
    `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object
    (on   which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number
    allocation costs * `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when
    performing operation, or   always return positive value. Second case applies
    to reduction operations   like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be
    negative - modulo will be   added to the result to make it positive  ###
    Postfixes  The only available postfix at the moment is:  * `n` - which means
    that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript   Number.
    Decimals are not supported.  ### Examples  * `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition
    on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a` * `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo
    `b`, returning positive value * `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by
    13  ## Instructions  Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the
    line. `endian` - could be either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian). 
    ### Utilities  * `a.clone()` - clone number * `a.toString(base, length)` -
    convert to base-string and pad with zeroes * `a.toNumber()` - convert to
    Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits) * `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON
    compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`) * `a.toArray(endian,
    length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero   pad to length,
    throwing if already exceeding * `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` -
    convert to an instance of `type`,   which must behave like an `Array` *
    `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available).
    For   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:  
    `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)` * `a.bitLength()` - get number of
    bits occupied * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant
    consequent zero bits   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits) *
    `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied * `a.isNeg()` - true if
    the number is negative * `a.isEven()` - no comments * `a.isOdd()` - no
    comments * `a.isZero()` - no comments * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and
    return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)   depending on the
    comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`) * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`) *
    `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater
    than `b` (`n`) * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`) *
    `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`) * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's
    complement representation, where `width` is bit width * `a.fromTwos(width)`
    - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit
    width * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js
    instance  ### Arithmetics  * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`) * `a.abs()` -
    absolute value (`i`) * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sub(b)` -
    subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`) *
    `a.sqr()` - square (`i`) * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b` *
    `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`) * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but
    no `umodn`) * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division  ### Bit operations  *
    `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`)
    (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced   with `andn` in future) * `a.xor(b)`
    - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1` *
    `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`,
    `u`, `iu`) * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set * `a.maskn(b)` -
    clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`) * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1
    << b` to the number * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`)
    (`i`)  ### Reduction  * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD
    results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`) * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo
    `b`  ## Fast reduction  When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo,
    it might be beneficial to use some tricks: like [Montgomery
    multiplication][0], or using special algorithm for [Mersenne Prime][1].  ###
    Reduction context  To enable this tricks one should create a reduction
    context:  ```js var red = BN.red(num); ``` where `num` is just a BN
    instance.  Or:  ```js var red = BN.red(primeName); ```  Where `primeName` is
    either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:  * `'k256'` * `'p224'` * `'p192'` *
    `'p25519'`  Or:  ```js var red = BN.mont(num); ```  To reduce numbers with
    [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than `.red(num)`, but
    slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.  ### Converting numbers  Before performing
    anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted to it. Usually,
    this means that one should:  * Convert inputs to reducted ones * Operate on
    them in reduction context * Convert outputs back from the reduction context 
    Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:  ```js var redA =
    a.toRed(red); ``` Where `red` is a reduction context created using
    instructions above  Here is how to convert them back:  ```js var a =
    redA.fromRed(); ```  ### Red instructions  Most of the instructions from the
    very start of this readme have their counterparts in red context:  *
    `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)` * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)` *
    `a.redShl(num)` * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)` * `a.redSqr()`,
    `a.redISqr()` * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
    * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number * `a.redNeg()` *
    `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation  ## LICENSE  This software is

    > A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / fsevents. 
    [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/chokidar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)
    [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/) 
    ## Why? Node.js `fs.watch`:  * Doesn't report filenames on OS X. * Doesn't
    report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X. * Often
    reports events twice. * Emits most changes as `rename`. * Has [a lot of
    other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
    * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.  Node.js
    `fs.watchFile`:  * Almost as bad at event handling. * Also does not provide
    any recursive watching. * Results in high CPU utilization.  Chokidar
    resolves these problems.  Initially made for [brunch](http://brunch.io) (an
    ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
    [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
    [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
    [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2), [browserify](http://browserify.org/),
    [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
    [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Microsoft's Visual Studio
    Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and [many
    others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/). It has proven
    itself in production environments.  ## How? Chokidar does still rely on the
    Node.js core `fs` module, but when using `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for
    watching, it normalizes the events it receives, often checking for truth by
    getting file stats and/or dir contents.  On Mac OS X, chokidar by default
    uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API. This provides
    very efficient recursive watching compared with implementations like
    `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still does have to do
    some work to normalize the events received that way as well.  On other
    platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which avoids
    polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
    watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
    specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching
    much more than needed.  ## Getting started Install with npm:      npm
    install chokidar --save  Then `require` and use it in your code:

    alwaysStat: false,   depth: 99,   awaitWriteFinish: {    
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,     pollInterval: 100   },   
    ignorePermissionErrors: false,   atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity
    delay', in milliseconds (default 100) });  ```  ## API 
    `chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`  * `paths` (string or array of strings).
    Paths to files, dirs to be watched recursively, or glob patterns. *
    `options` (object) Options object as defined below:  #### Persistence  *
    `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process should
    continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to `false` when
    using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted after `ready`,
    even if the process continues to run.  #### Path filtering  * `ignored`
    ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
    Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
    tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
    gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
    time with two arguments (the path and the
    [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object of that
    path). * `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then
    `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
    instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before
    the `ready` event). * `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only
    the symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following the
    link references and bubbling events through the link's path. * `cwd` (no
    default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be derived.
    Paths emitted with events will be relative to this. * `disableGlobbing`
    (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()`
    and `.add()` are treated as literal path names, even if they look like
    globs.  #### Performance  * `usePolling` (default: `false`). Whether to use
    fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU
    utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is typically necessary to
    **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over a network**, and it
    may be necessary to successfully watch files in other non-standard
    situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the `useFsEvents`
    default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable to true (1)
    or false (0) in order to override this option. * _Polling-specific settings_
    (effective when `usePolling: true`)   * `interval` (default: `100`).
    Interval of file system polling. You may also      set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL
    env variable to override this option.   * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`).
    Interval of file system   polling for binary files.   ([see list of binary
    extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
    * `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the `fsevents`
    watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly and
    `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When set
    to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default. * `alwaysStat`
    (default: `false`). If relying upon the
    [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object that
    may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set this to `true`
    to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't already available
    from the underlying watch events. * `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set,
    limits how many levels of subdirectories will be traversed. *
    `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`). By default, the `add` event will fire
    when a file first appears on disk, before the entire file has been written.
    Furthermore, in some cases some `change` events will be emitted while the
    file is being written. In some cases, especially when watching for large
    files there will be a need to wait for the write operation to finish before
    responding to a file creation or modification. Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to
    `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size, holding its `add` and
    `change` events until the size does not change for a configurable amount of
    time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily dependent on the OS and
    hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should be relatively high,
    making file watching much less responsive. Use with caution.   *
    *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust  
    timing params:*   * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000).
    Amount of time in   milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before
    emitting its event.   * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File
    size polling interval.  #### Errors * `ignorePermissionErrors` (default:
    `false`). Indicates whether to watch files that don't have read permissions
    if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM` or `EACCES` with this set to
    `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently. * `atomic` (default: `true`
    if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`). Automatically filters out
    artifacts that occur when using editors that use 'atomic writes' instead of
    writing directly to the source file. If a file is re-added within 100 ms of
    being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event rather than `unlink` then
    `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well for you, you can override
    it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in milliseconds.  ### Methods &
    Events  `chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of
    `FSWatcher`:  * `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob
    patterns for tracking. Takes an array of strings or just one string. *
    `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event. Available events: `add`,
    `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`, `raw`, `error`.
    Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
    name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`. *
    `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob
    patterns. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.close()`:
    Removes all listeners from watched files. * `.getWatched()`: Returns an
    object representing all the paths on the file system being watched by this
    `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the directories (using
    absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the values are arrays
    of the names of the items contained in each directory.  ## CLI  If you need
    a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
    [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you
    to execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change
    events.  ## Install Troubleshooting  * `npm WARN optional dep failed,
    continuing fsevents@n.n.n`   * This message is normal part of how `npm`
    handles optional dependencies and is     not indicative of a problem. Even
    if accompanied by other related error messages,     Chokidar should function
    properly.  * `ERR! stack Error: Python executable 'python' is v3.4.1, which
    is not supported by gyp.`   * You should be able to resolve this by
    installing python 2.7 and running:     `npm config set python python2.7`  *
    `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`   * On Mac, install the XCode
    command-line tools  ## License  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2016

  licenseText: "# Cyclist  Cyclist is an efficient [cyclic list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) implemention for Javascript. It is available through npm  \tnpm install cyclist  ## What?  Cyclist allows you to create a list of fixed size that is cyclic. In a cyclist list the element following the last one is the first one. This property can be really useful when for example trying to order data packets that can arrive out of order over a network stream.  ## Usage  ``` js var cyclist = require('cyclist'); var list = cyclist(4); // if size (4) is not a power of 2 it will be the follwing power of 2                        // this buffer can now hold 4 elements in total  list.put(42, 'hello 42'); // store something and index 42 list.put(43, 'hello 43'); // store something and index 43  console.log(list.get(42)); // prints hello 42 console.log(list.get(46)); // prints hello 42 again since 46 - 42 == list.size ```  ## API  * `cyclist(size)` creates a new buffer * `cyclist#get(index)` get an object stored in the buffer * `cyclist#put(index,value)` insert an object into the buffer * `cyclist#del(index)` delete an object from an index * `cyclist#size` property containing current size of buffer  ## License  MIT"

    CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION     1.
    Definitions.        'License' shall mean the terms and conditions for use,
    reproduction,       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of
    this document.        'Licensor' shall mean the copyright owner or entity
    authorized by       the copyright owner that is granting the License.       
    'Legal Entity' shall mean the union of the acting entity and all       other
    entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common       control
    with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,       'control' means
    (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the       direction or
    management of such entity, whether by contract or       otherwise, or (ii)
    ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the       outstanding shares, or
    (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.        'You' (or 'Your') shall
    mean an individual or Legal Entity       exercising permissions granted by
    this License.        'Source' form shall mean the preferred form for making
    modifications,       including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation       source, and configuration files.        'Object' form
    shall mean any form resulting from mechanical       transformation or
    translation of a Source form, including but       not limited to compiled
    object code, generated documentation,       and conversions to other media
    types.        'Work' shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source
    or       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by
    a       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work      
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        'Derivative Works'
    shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based
    on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a
    whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this
    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain      
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,      
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any
    work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any
    modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
    by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized
    to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
    definition, 'submitted'       means any form of electronic, verbal, or
    written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives,
    including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing
    lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that
    are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of
    discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is
    conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the
    copyright owner as 'Not a Contribution.'        'Contributor' shall mean
    Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a
    Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently
    incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to
    the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
    and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
    form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
    perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims
    licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
    their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
    submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
    direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4.
    Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications,
    and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following
    conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work
    or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You
    must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating
    that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source
    form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright,
    patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of
    the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
    of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a
    'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy
    of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the
    Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within
    a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with
    the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices
    normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for
    informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may
    add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
    the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot
    be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own
    copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional
    or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or
    distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works
    as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the
    Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this
    License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in
    the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
    conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or
    conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6.
    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade      
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,      
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the      
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.
    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to
    in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides
    its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without
    limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or
    redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability.
    In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in
    writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of
    any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or
    inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for
    loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
    any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such
    Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.    
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing      
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and
    charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other
    liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License.
    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own
    behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other
    Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each
    Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted
    against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such
    warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS    
    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.        To apply the
    Apache License to your work, attach the following       boilerplate notice,
    with the fields enclosed by brackets '{}'       replaced with your own
    identifying information. (Don't include       the brackets!)  The text
    should be enclosed in the appropriate       comment syntax for the file
    format. We also recommend that a       file or class name and description of
    purpose be included on the       same 'printed page' as the copyright notice

    Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation. 
    NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a
    curve for your cryptography operations.  ## Incentive  ECC is much slower
    than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are even more slower. 
    ## Benchmarks  ```bash $ node benchmarks/index.js Benchmarking: sign

    ```  ## API  ### ECDSA  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec;  //
    Create and initialize EC context // (better do it once and reuse it) var ec
    = new EC('secp256k1');  // Generate keys var key = ec.genKeyPair();  // Sign
    the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string) var msgHash = [
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]; var signature = key.sign(msgHash);  //
    Export DER encoded signature in Array var derSign = signature.toDER();  //
    Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));  // CHECK WITH
    NO PRIVATE KEY  var pubPoint = key.getPublic(); var x = pubPoint.getX(); var
    y = pubPoint.getY();  // Public Key MUST be either: // 1) '04' + hex string
    of x + hex string of y; or // 2) object with two hex string properties (x
    and y); or // 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y) var pub =
    pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1 var pub =
    { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2 var pub =
    { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3 var pub =
    { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3  // Import
    public key var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');  // Signature MUST be
    either: // 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or // 2) DER-encoded
    signature as buffer; or // 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and
    s); or // 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)  var signature =
    '3046022100...'; // case 1 var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2 var
    signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3  // Verify signature
    console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### EdDSA  ```javascript
    var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;  // Create and initialize EdDSA
    context // (better do it once and reuse it) var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519'); 
    // Create key pair from secret var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); //
    hex string, array or Buffer  // Sign the message's hash (input must be an
    array, or a hex-string) var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
    var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();  // Verify signature
    console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));  // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY 
    // Import public key var pub = '0a1af638...'; var key =
    ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');  // Verify signature var signature =
    '70bed1...'; console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### ECDH 
    ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new
    EC('curve25519');  // Generate keys var key1 = ec.genKeyPair(); var key2 =
    ec.genKeyPair();  var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic()); var shared2 =
    key2.derive(key1.getPublic());  console.log('Both shared secrets are BN
    instances'); console.log(shared1.toString(16));
    console.log(shared2.toString(16)); ```  three and more members:
    ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new
    EC('curve25519');  var A = ec.genKeyPair(); var B = ec.genKeyPair(); var C =
    ec.genKeyPair();  var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate()) var BC =
    B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate()) var CA =
    C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())  var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate()) var BCA
    = BC.mul(A.getPrivate()) var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate()) 
    console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16)) console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
    console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16)) ```  NOTE: `.derive()` returns a
    [BN][1] instance.  ## Supported curves  Elliptic.js support following curve
    types:  * Short Weierstrass * Montgomery * Edwards * Twisted Edwards 
    Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:  * `secp256k1` *
    `p192` * `p224` * `p256` * `p384` * `p521` * `curve25519` * `ed25519`  NOTE:
    That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.  ###
    Implementation details  ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as
    per [RFC6979][0]. Most of the curve operations are performed on non-affine
    coordinates (either projective or extended), various windowing techniques
    are used for different cases.  All operations are performed in reduction
    context using [bn.js][1], hashing is provided by [hash.js][2]  ### Related
    projects  * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and
    ECIES for both   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and
    [secp256k1-node][4] for   node)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed

    [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org)
    error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*. 
    [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)

    * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a
    name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more
    details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno
    mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:** 
    ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code':
    'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By
    code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53,
    //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //  
    } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno =
    require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's
    a libuv error then get the description from errno   if
    (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description  
    else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a
    'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return
    str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt',
    function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use
    as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code':
    'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {  
    'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~
    $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full
    list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install
    with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available
    without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a
    name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()`
    to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library.
    Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking
    errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance
    of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the
    original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var
    create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError')
    // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError)
    // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  //
    use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad
    happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also
    available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno
    properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err)
    return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something
    else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will
    have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will
    contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  *

    ### Esrecurse [![Build
    Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse) 
    Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
    [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
    recursive traversing functionality.  ### Example Usage  The following code
    will output all variables declared at the root of a file.  ```javascript
    esrecurse.visit(ast, {     XXXStatement: function (node) {        
    this.visit(node.left);         // do something...        
    this.visit(node.right);     } }); ```  We can use `Visitor` instance. 
    ```javascript var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({     XXXStatement:
    function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do
    something...         this.visit(node.right);     } });  visitor.visit(ast);
    ```  We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.  ```javascript class Derived
    extends esrecurse.Visitor {     constructor()     {         super(null);    
    }      XXXStatement(node) {     } } ```  ```javascript function
    DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */ 
    this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); }
    util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
    DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {    
    this.visit(node.left);     // do something...     this.visit(node.right); };
    ```  And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit
    operation.  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {    
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object
    automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor,
    esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node)
    {     // do something...     this.visitChildren(node); }; ```  The
    `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of
    `this.visitChildren(node)`. We can use user-defined node types. 
    ```javascript // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
    var tree = {     type: 'TestExpression',      // This 'argument' is the
    property containing the other **node**.     argument: {         type:
    'Literal',         value: 20     },      // This 'extended' is the property
    not containing the other **node**.     extended: true };
    esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node)
    {             // do something...         }     },     {         // Extending
    the existing traversing rules.         childVisitorKeys: {             //
    TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**'
    ]             TestExpression: ['argument']         }     } ); ```  We can
    use the `fallback` option as well. If the `fallback` option is
    `'iteration'`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown
    nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might
    have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g.
    `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {        
    Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }    
    },     {         fallback: 'iteration'     } ); ```  If the `fallback`
    option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the
    enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references
    cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional
    properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript
    esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node)
    {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback:
    function (node) {             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key)
    {                 return key !== 'argument'             });         }     }
    ); ```  ### License  Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke

  version: 0.1.4
  description: An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3
  copyright: ''
  licenses: MIT
  licenseFile: node_modules/imurmurhash/README.md
  licenseModified: 'no'
  licenseText: >-
    iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the
    MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's
    implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with
    [kazuyukitanimura's
    modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This
    version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you
    need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string
    concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental
    version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version
    was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing. 
    Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the
    latest
    version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js)
    and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script
    type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script>
    // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
    </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using
    NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your
    scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick
    Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var
    hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text
    hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All
    calls can be chained if desired
    hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result
    hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ###
    MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally
    initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive
    integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will
    return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as
    long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are
    created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you
    can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript //
    Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same //
    object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState =
    MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however
    you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state
    object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more
    objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed
    however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ###
    MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash.
    This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object,
    including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be
    chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the
    hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer
    portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state
    object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then
    continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at
    once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do
    part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m =
    MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test
    string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ###
    MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse,
    optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor).
    Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) -------------

    # minipass  A _very_ minimal implementation of a [PassThrough
    stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough) 
    [It's very
    fast](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oObKSrVwLX_7Ut4Z6g3fZW-AX1j1-k6w-cDsrkaSbHM/edit#gid=0)
    for objects, strings, and buffers.  Supports pipe()ing (including
    multi-pipe() and backpressure transmission), buffering data until either a
    `data` event handler or `pipe()` is added (so you don't lose the first
    chunk), and most other cases where PassThrough is a good idea.  There is a
    `read()` method, but it's much more efficient to consume data from this
    stream via `'data'` events or by calling `pipe()` into some other stream. 
    Calling `read()` requires the buffer to be flattened in some cases, which
    requires copying memory.  Also, `read()` always returns Buffers, even if an
    `encoding` option is specified.  There is also no `unpipe()` method.  Once
    you start piping, there is no stopping it!  If you set `objectMode: true` in
    the options, then whatever is written will be emitted.  Otherwise, it'll do
    a minimal amount of Buffer copying to ensure proper Streams semantics when
    `read(n)` is called.  This is not a `through` or `through2` stream.  It
    doesn't transform the data, it just passes it right through.  If you want to
    transform the data, extend the class, and override the `write()` method. 
    Once you're done transforming the data however you want, call
    `super.write()` with the transform output.  For an example of a stream that
    extends MiniPass to provide transform capabilities, check out
    [minizlib](http://npm.im/minizlib).  ## USAGE  ```js const MiniPass =
    require('minipass') const mp = new MiniPass(options) // optional: { encoding
    } mp.write('foo') mp.pipe(someOtherStream) mp.end('bar') ```

    Source or    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by
    a    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work    (an
    example is provided in the Appendix below).     'Derivative Works' shall
    mean any work, whether in Source or Object    form, that is based on (or
    derived from) the Work and for which the    editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications    represent, as a whole,
    an original work of authorship. For the purposes    of this License,
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain    separable from, or
    merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,    the Work and
    Derivative Works thereof.     'Contribution' shall mean any work of
    authorship, including    the original version of the Work and any
    modifications or additions    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that
    is intentionally    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the

    on behalf of    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
    'submitted'    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written

    Contribution.'     'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or
    Legal Entity    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by
    Licensor and    subsequently incorporated within the Work.  2. Grant of
    Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of    this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,    worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable    copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,    publicly display, publicly
    perform, sublicense, and distribute the    Work and such Derivative Works in
    Source or Object form.  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
    perpetual,    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
    Work,    where such license applies only to those patent claims
    licensable    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their   
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)    with the
    Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You    institute patent
    litigation against any entity (including a    cross-claim or counterclaim in
    a lawsuit) alleging that the Work    or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct    or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses    granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate    as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the    Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without    modifications, and in Source or
    Object form, provided that You    meet the following conditions:     (a) You
    must give any other recipients of the Work or        Derivative Works a copy
    of this License; and     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry
    prominent notices        stating that You changed the files; and     (c) You
    must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works        that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and        attribution notices
    from the Source form of the Work,        excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of        the Derivative Works; and     (d) If the Work
    includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its        distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must        include a readable copy of
    the attribution notices contained        within such NOTICE file, excluding
    those notices that do not        pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one        of the following places: within a NOTICE text
    file distributed        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
    form or        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
    or,        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and       
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents        of
    the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and        do not modify
    the License. You may add Your own attribution        notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside        or as an addendum to
    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        that such additional
    attribution notices cannot be construed        as modifying the License.    
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and    may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions    for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or    for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,    reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with    the conditions stated in
    this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of   
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.    Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify    the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed    with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of
    the Licensor,    except as required for reasonable and customary use in
    describing the    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
    NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law
    or    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each   
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,    WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or    implied,
    including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    of TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any    risks associated with Your
    exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In
    no event and under no legal theory,    whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise,    unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
    shall any Contributor be    liable to You for damages, including any direct,
    indirect, special,    incidental, or consequential damages of any character
    arising as a    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
    the    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,   
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor    has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional
    Liability. While redistributing    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You
    may choose to offer,    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
    warranty, indemnity,    or other liability obligations and/or rights
    consistent with this    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
    may act only    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
    behalf    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,   
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability    incurred by,
    or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason    of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    list things in node_modules that are bundledDependencies, or transitive

  licenseModified: 'no'
  licenseText: >-
    # npm-bundled  Run this in a node package, and it'll tell you which things
    in node_modules are bundledDependencies, or transitive dependencies of
    bundled dependencies.  ## USAGE  To get the list of deps at the top level
    that are bundled (or transitive deps of a bundled dep) run this:  ```js
    const bundled = require('npm-bundled')  // async version bundled({ path:
    '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}, (er, list) => {   // er means it had an
    error, which is _hella_ weird   // list is a list of package names, like
    `fooblz` or `@corp/blerg`   // the might not all be deps of the top level,
    because transitives })  // async promise version bundled({ path:
    '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}).then(list => {   // so promisey!   //
    actually the callback version returns a promise, too, it just   // attaches
    the supplied callback to the promise })  // sync version, throws if there's
    an error const list = bundled({ path: '/path/to/pkg/defaults/to/cwd'}) ``` 
    That's basically all you need to know.  If you care to dig into it, you can
    also use the `bundled.Walker` and `bundled.WalkerSync` classes to get
    fancy.  This library does not write anything to the filesystem, but it _may_
    have undefined behavior if the structure of `node_modules` changes while
    it's reading deps.  All symlinks are followed.  This means that it can lead
    to surprising results if a symlinked bundled dependency has a missing
    dependency that is satisfied at the top level.  Since package creation
    resolves symlinks as well, this is an edge case where package creation and
    development environment are not going to be aligned, and is best avoided.

    # run-queue  A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with
    concurrency limiting.  ```js const RunQueue = require('run-queue')  const
    queue = new RunQueue({   maxConcurrency: 1 })  queue.add(1, example, [-1])
    for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {   queue.add(0, example, [ii]) } const
    finished = [] queue.run().then(   console.log(finished) })  function example
    (num, next) {   setTimeout(() => {     finished.push(num)     next()   }, 5
    - Math.abs(num)) } ```  would output  ``` [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ] ```  If you
    bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:  ``` [ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ] ```  The
    concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take longer
    than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the next
    priority level is run.  See
    [PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
    even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
    can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:  ``` [ 4, 3,
    2, 1, 0, -1 ] ```  ## API  ### const queue = new RunQueue(options)  Create a
    new queue. Options may contain:  * maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The
    maximum number of jobs to execute at once. * Promise - (Default:
    global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.  ### queue.add (prio, fn,
    args)  Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will
    run `fn` with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.  ###
    queue.run ()  Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves
    when either all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or
    returns a rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will
    be rejected with that error and no further queue running will be done.  ##
    PRIORITIES  Priorities are any integer value >= 0.  Lowest is executed
    first.  Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a
    queue must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed. 
    This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
    must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
    while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
    queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
    complete.

    ---          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE            Version 2, June 1991  
    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  51 Franklin Street,
    Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA  Everyone is permitted to copy and
    distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not
    allowed.            Preamble    The licenses for most software are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU
    General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
    change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
    This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using
    it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU
    Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs,
    too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
    the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
    it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
    programs; and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your
    rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these
    rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate
    to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
    software, or if you modify it.    For example, if you distribute copies of
    such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
    all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
    can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know
    their rights.    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
    software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
    copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    Also, for each author's
    protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that
    there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by
    someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
    have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
    reflect on the original authors' reputations.    Finally, any free program
    is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger
    that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent
    licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we
    have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
    or not licensed at all.    The precise terms and conditions for copying,
    distribution and modification follow.          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION    0. This
    License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
    by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
    General Public License.  The 'Program', below, refers to any such program or
    work, and a 'work based on the Program' means either the Program or any
    derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
    Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term 'modification'.)  Each licensee is addressed
    as 'you'.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
    not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of
    having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on
    what the Program does.    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of
    the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
    that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
    other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
    Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
    you also meet all of these conditions:      a) You must cause the modified
    files to carry prominent notices     stating that you changed the files and
    the date of any change.      b) You must cause any work that you distribute
    or publish, that in     whole or in part contains or is derived from the
    Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
    all third     parties under the terms of this License.      c) If the
    modified program normally reads commands interactively     when run, you
    must cause it, when started running for such     interactive use in the most
    ordinary way, to print or display an     announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a     notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide     a warranty) and that users may
    redistribute the program under     these conditions, and telling the user
    how to view a copy of this     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself
    is interactive but     does not normally print such an announcement, your
    work based on     the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
    this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
    distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
    and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of
    this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
    by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
    distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In
    addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
    Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
    it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:     
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     source
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     1 and 2
    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,      b)
    Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     years, to
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your     cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete     machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be     distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium     customarily used for software interchange;
    or,      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
    offer     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is    
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     received the
    program in object code or executable form with such     an offer, in accord
    with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred
    form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
    complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
    that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
    major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by
    offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
    the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.    4. You may not copy, modify,
    sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under
    this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
    distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
    from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long
    as such parties remain in full compliance.    5. You are not required to
    accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else
    grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
    works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
    License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
    based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
    so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.    6. Each time you redistribute the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify
    the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
    further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
    herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
    of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so
    as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
    other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
    the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
    infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
    of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by
    public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to
    the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended
    to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
    this License.    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
    restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
    interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
    License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the
    limitation as if written in the body of this License.    9. The Free
    Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
    Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
    spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version
    number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
    applies to it and 'any later version', you have the option of following the
    terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version

    reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this
    document.  'Licensor' shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
    the copyright owner that is granting the License.  'Legal Entity' shall mean
    the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are

    purposes of this definition, 'control' means (i) the power, direct or
    indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
    contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
    the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.  'You'
    (or 'Your') shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
    granted by this License.  'Source' form shall mean the preferred form for
    making modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation source, and configuration files.  'Object' form shall mean any
    form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source
    form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated
    documentation, and conversions to other media types.  'Work' shall mean the
    work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under
    the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or
    attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
    'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
    whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
    merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
    Works thereof.  'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to
    Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
    individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright
    owner. For the purposes of this definition, 'submitted' means any form of
    electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
    representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
    mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
    are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
    and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
    marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as 'Not a
    Contribution.'  'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or
    Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
    and subsequently incorporated within the Work.  2. Grant of Copyright
    License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
    distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  3.
    Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
    this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
    import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
    those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
    License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
    filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
    following conditions:  You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and 
    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and  If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text
    file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
    distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
    part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
    within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the
    Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if
    and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
    NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
    License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
    that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
    Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
    modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
    conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
    in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in
    the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
    Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
    the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7.
    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
    Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
    KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8.
    Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
    tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
    in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional
    Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You
    may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
    indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
    own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
    Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
    Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
    against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
    additional liability.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    An RFC 3986/3987 compliant, scheme extendable URI/IRI
    parsing/validating/resolving library for JavaScript.
  copyright: Copyright 2011 Gary Court. All rights reserved.
  licenses: BSD-2-Clause
  licenseFile: node_modules/uri-js/README.md
  licenseModified: 'no'
  licenseText: "# URI.js  URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc). It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.  URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing  \tURI.parse('uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body'); \t//returns: \t//{ \t//  scheme : 'uri', \t//  userinfo : 'user:pass', \t//  host : 'example.com', \t//  port : 123, \t//  path : '/one/two.three', \t//  query : 'q1=a1&q2=a2', \t//  fragment : 'body' \t//}  ### Serializing  \tURI.serialize({scheme : 'http', host : 'example.com', fragment : 'footer'}) === 'http://example.com/#footer'  ### Resolving  \tURI.resolve('uri://a/b/c/d?q', '../../g') === 'uri://a/g'  ### Normalizing  \tURI.normalize('HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html') === 'http://abc.com/~smith/home.html'  ### Comparison  \tURI.equal('example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D', 'eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d') === true  ### IP Support  \t//IPv4 normalization \tURI.normalize('//192.068.001.000') === '//192.68.1.0'  \t//IPv6 normalization \tURI.normalize('//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]') === '//[2001:0:db8::1]'  \t//IPv6 zone identifier support \tURI.parse('//[2001:db8::7%25en1]'); \t//returns: \t//{ \t//  host : '2001:db8::7%en1' \t//}  ### IRI Support  \t//convert IRI to URI \tURI.serialize(URI.parse('http://examplé.org/rosé')) === 'http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9' \t//convert URI to IRI \tURI.serialize(URI.parse('http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'), {iri:true}) === 'http://examplé.org/rosé'  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *\t`scheme` (string)  \tIndicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  *\t`reference` (string)  \tIf set to `'suffix'`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *\t`tolerant` (boolean, false)  \tIf set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  *\t`absolutePath` (boolean, false)  \tIf set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *\t`iri` (boolean, false)  \tIf set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *\t`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)  \tIf set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *\t`domainHost` (boolean, false)  \tIf set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\] *\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\] *\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\] *\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\] *\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]  ### HTTP Support  \tURI.equal('HTTP://ABC.COM:80', 'http://abc.com/') === true  ### Mailto Support  \tURI.parse('mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!'); \t//returns: \t//{ \t//\tscheme : 'mailto', \t//\tto : ['alpha@example.com', 'bravo@example.com'], \t//\tsubject : 'SUBSCRIBE', \t//\tbody : 'Sign me up!' \t//}  \tURI.serialize({ \t\tscheme : 'mailto', \t\tto : ['alpha@example.com'], \t\tsubject : 'REMOVE', \t\tbody : 'Please remove me', \t\theaders : { \t\t\tcc : 'charlie@example.com' \t\t} \t}) === 'mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me'  ### URN Support  \tURI.parse('urn:example:foo'); \t//returns: \t//{ \t//\tscheme : 'urn', \t//\tnid : 'example', \t//\tnss : 'foo', \t//}  #### URN UUID Support  \tURI.parse('urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'); \t//returns: \t//{ \t//\tscheme : 'urn', \t//\tnid : 'example', \t//\tuuid : 'f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6', \t//}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:  \t<script type='text/javascript' src='uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js'></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:  \tnpm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:  \tconst URI = require('uri-js');  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:  \timport * as URI from 'uri-js';  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:  \timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from 'uri-js';  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.
