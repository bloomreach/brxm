Sandbox Standard Disclaimer
========================================

WARNING!

  All user accessible points in the sandbox packages are to be considered
  "alpha". This means that the developer team is not investing _any_ effort
  in providing back compatibility between alpha releases.

  This software will continue to be released as "alpha" until both code, 
  schemas and APIs will be considered stable.

  Until then, there will be no warranty that newer versions will maintain back
  compatibility even in the most simple cases.

  On the other hand, once "beta" status is reached, back incompatible changes
  will be made only if absolutely necessary to reach "final" status.

  The development team understands the importance of reliable software 
  as well as the importance of protecting user investments by the
  creation of a solid development platform that doesn't change.

  On the other hand, being the project a pioneer in many fields, this
  cannot be guaranteed before a final status is reached for the software.

  Until then, no effort will be provided to guarantee back compatibility.

  You have been warned.
