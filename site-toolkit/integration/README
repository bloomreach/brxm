The integration tests reside in the tests module, the war module contains a web application
that must be started before the integration tests are run. Tests connect to the remote repository over RMI.
The test suite itself also starts up a repository that is clustered against the same database.

To execute all integration tests at once, change to the repository-tests or hst-tests directory and run:
$ mvn -Pintegration
This will automatically start cargo and deploy the clustered repository. The integration suite is then
run and finally cargo is stopped again.

*** For fast development ***

You can start cargo in standalone mode and run individual tests
Change to the repository-tests or hst-tests directory directory and run:
$ mvn -Pcargo.run

now you can  individual tests
$ mvn -Pstandalone -Dtest=HstIntegrationTest

or with external debugger (port 5005) attached:

$ mvn -Pstandalone -Dtest=HstIntegrationTest -Dmaven.failsafe.debug=true


// TODO running the tests from my IDE did not yet work
*** Running tests from your IDE ***

Change to the repository-tests or hst-tests directory directory and run:
$ mvn -Pcargo.run

In the test class debug configuration add VM arg:

-Drepo.config=file:/abs/path/to/integration/hst-tests/conf/repository.xml

or

-Drepo.config=file:/abs/path/to/integration/repository-tests/conf/repository.xml
