/**
 * <p>A {@link Mount} object is the mount from a prefix to some (sub)site *or* content location: when the {@link Mount#isMapped()} property returns <code>true</code> or missing,
 * the {@link Mount} is linked to a {@link HstSite} that uses a {@link HstSiteMap}. When {@link Mount#isMapped()} property returns <code>false</code>, the {@link Mount} won't use
 * a URL mapping through the {@link HstSiteMap}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link Mount} is a Composite pattern: Each {@link Mount} can contain any descendant
 * child {@link Mount} tree. A {@link Mount} 'lives' below a {@link VirtualHost}. The {@link Mount} directly below a {@link VirtualHost} <b>must</b> be called <b>hst:root</b> by definition.
 * The <code>hst:root</code> {@link Mount} is where the {@link Mount} matching starts. Once a virtual host is matched for the incoming {@link HttpServletRequest},
 * we inspect the request path (the path after the context path and before the query string) and try to match the request path as deep as possible to the {@link Mount} tree: note that
 * we try to map to the best matching {@link Mount}: This means, that 'exact' matching names have precedence over wildcard names
 * </p>
 *
 * Thus, suppose we have the following {@link Mount} tree configuration:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    +127.0.0.1
 *       +hst:root
 *           - hst:mountpoint = /content/documents/myproject
 *           - hst:ismapped = true
 *           + subsite
 *              - hst:mountpoint = /content/documents/subsite
 *              - hst:ismapped = true
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The configuration above means, that below the host 127.0.0.1 we have of course the mandatory {@link Mount} <code>hst:root</code>, and below it, we have
 * a {@link Mount} <code>subsite</code>. Every request path that starts with <code>/subsite</code> will be mapped to 'subsite' {@link Mount}, all other request path's that do not start with '/subsite'
 * resolve to the <code>hst:root<code> item. While the request path does match the next {@link Mount} descendant in the tree, the matching is continued to descendant {@link Mount} items. Thus, in the current example,
 * the request path <code>/subsite/home</code> will return the {@link Mount} with name 'subsite'.
 * </p>
 *
 * Also, you can configure some of the same properties the {@link VirtualHost} also has:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>hst:port (long)</li>
 *  <li>hst:showcontextpath (boolean)</li>
 *  <li>hst:showport(boolean)</li>
 *  <li>hst:scheme (string)</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 * <p>One extra is possible, <code>hst:namedpipeline</code>, see below for an example.</p>
 *
 * <p>Just as with the virtual hosts, properties are <b>inherited</b> by child {@link Mount} items as long as they are not defined by themselves
 * </p>
 *
 * Obviously, the above configuration might not be desirable in some circumstances, for example, when on a production host, you do not want
 * a preview available at all. Configuration then for example could be:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    +www.mycompany.com
 *        +hst:root
 *           - hst:mountpoint = /content/documents/myproject
 *    +sub.mycompany.com
 *        +hst:root
 *           - hst:mountpoint = /content/documents/subsite
 * </pre>
 *
 * Optionally, wildcard matching support can be implemented, where the wilcards can be used within the property values. For example:
 * </p>
