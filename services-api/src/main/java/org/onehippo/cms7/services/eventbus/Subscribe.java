/**
 * Annotation for single-argument (void) methods that indicates that the method is a listener.
 * The parameter type is to be used to filter events.
 * <p>
 * Annotated methods may be invoked synchronously or asynchronously, depending on which eventbus
 * they are delivered, but in any case must refrain from expensive operations since that will block
 * the entire event delivery mechanism, and also the event raising process in case of synchronous events.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is a fork of the guava eventbus annotation.  This was necessary since we do not
 * want to push the guava library (see http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) onto the shared
 * class path.
