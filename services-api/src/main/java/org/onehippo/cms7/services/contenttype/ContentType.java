/**
 * An immutable Hippo Content Type representation providing a more relaxed and enhanced form of an {@link EffectiveNodeType}
 * exposing only non-residual {@link ContentTypeProperty} and {@link ContentTypeChild} elements with additional meta-data describing these {@link ContentTypeItem ContentTypeItems}.
 * <p>
 * A ContentType is always backed by an underlying EffectiveNodeType, and for all EffectiveNodeTypes a ContentType is provided.
 * For EffectiveNodeTypes which do not have a corresponding ContentType pre-defined, a ContentType definition is automatically derived, see {@link #isDerivedType()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getProperties()} and {@link #getChildren()} methods provides direct access to these elements, but also can be access separately by name through {@link #getItem(String)}
 * <br/>
 * <em>Note that in case of a {@link #isDerivedType()} both a ContentTypeProperty and ContentTypeChild element may be defined by the same name, in which case {@link #getItem(String)} will
 * only provide access to the corresponding child element (see also JCR-2.0 5.1.8).</em>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some pre-defined ContentTypes may represent an aggregate ({@link #isAggregate()}) which means that the ContentType also combines one or more mixin types, besides possibly having superTypes as well.
 * This can happen when a pre-defined ContentType is enhanced with one or more mixins after its initial definition, as well as its underlying JCR NodeType definition was created,
 * Currently the Jackrabbit JCR repository doesn't support adding extra mixins to an existing NodeType definition, thus for ContentTypes these must be aggregated separately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ContentType definitions representing existing the EffectiveNodeType of an JCR Node instance can also be an aggregate if the Node instance has additional mixins besides its primary NodeType.
 * </p>
